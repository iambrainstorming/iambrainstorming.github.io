<p>The problem with our education system:<br />
<strong>Most (99%) books referred by our teachers (whether its schools or higher education), not even meet a single criterion, most importantly posing probing questions and linking abstract concepts with concrete representations, which are the foundation for learning and comprehension/understanding.</strong><br />
The result is the student just try to score marks by repeating facts without being critical about it.<br />
The bad books are the main reason why we have bad teachers and bad students. It's not that teacher doesn't work hard, they just don't teach which meet the criteria, so that learning happens.<br />
It's not even fault of the <strong>administration</strong>, they <strong>put the books in the library what teacher recommend to them</strong>, and also naive students prefer books recommended by teachers.</p>
<h4 id="some-of-the-books-that-meets-all-the-criteria-and-can-be-used-as-a-reference-to-identify-the-patterns-of-good-books"><a class="header" href="#some-of-the-books-that-meets-all-the-criteria-and-can-be-used-as-a-reference-to-identify-the-patterns-of-good-books"><strong>Some of the books that meets all the criteria and can be used as a reference to identify the patterns of good books:</strong></a></h4>
<p><em>(You can skip this section for later analysis and jump to the patterns and features of good books)</em></p>
<p>Conceptual Physics, by Paul G. Hewitt<br />
The book is very well written, the book almost unraveling everything in physics with real-world examples. You will understand physics with concrete examples rather than just with abstract formulas and equations. Also, it has a practice book equally important. This book is right for understanding physics at the undergraduate and high school level.</p>
<p>Chemistry a Molecular Approach, Â Nivaldo J Tro<br />
Books with lots of diagrams, probing questions, all abstract concepts are represented with concrete examples and analogy, repeatedly alternating problems with their solutions provided and problems that students must solve, regular assessments with right questions.</p>
<p>Organic Chemistry as a Second Language, David Klein (First and Second Semester)<br />
Author has terrifically written the book on organic chemistry. You will understand organic chemistry like never before, and no need to memorize just the equations and reactions day and night which are just a junk for students.</p>
<p>Campbell Biology, Reece, Urry, Cain et. al.<br />
In India, biology is taught in most horrible manner. Biology means how much memory you have, how much memorization you can do, not how much you understand the subject.<br />
This book addresses the problem. You will understand biology and connect it to the real world. The diagrams in it are also wonderful. The questions in it promote inquiry and critical thinking.</p>
<p>Genetics A Conceptual Approach, Benjamin Pierce<br />
Even though it's not for high school students, but a must for undergraduate teachers. Teachers should follow the book and come for an inquiry-based lecture.</p>
<p>Molecular Biology of the Cell, Alberts<br />
A must for undergraduate and high school teachers. It has also got a problems book which contains gem like questions, which needs to be discussed among the students at the undergraduate and higher secondary level.</p>
<p>Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry<br />
It's another book, which lazy teachers are scared of. But without making an effort to understand biology, how will a teacher promote understanding among students?</p>
<p>Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology, Martinin, Nath<br />
Meticulously well-written book of anatomy and physiology, which an undergraduate teacher must follow.</p>
<h2 id="here-are-some-of-the-more-features-and-patterns-that-a-good-book-should-contain"><a class="header" href="#here-are-some-of-the-more-features-and-patterns-that-a-good-book-should-contain"><strong>Here are some of the more features and patterns that a good book should contain:</strong></a></h2>
<p>1)Â Statements or ideas or concepts should be <strong>backed by adequate examples and research data as evidence</strong>. Formulas should be provided with its implementation examples in physical situations.<br />
e.g.<br />
Have you ever heard the phrase âform follows function?â Itâs a philosophy practiced in many industries. In architecture, this means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities that will be carried out inside them. For example, a skyscraper should be built with several elevator banks; a hospital should be built so that its emergency room is easily accessible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>One example is not enough, provide as many as you can to explain its use in a different context and situations</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/example.png" alt="example" /></p>
<p>Function and Limits from book Essential Calculus by James Stewart</p>
<p><strong>Give example questions to classify from several antagonistic observations.</strong></p>
<p>e.g. In probability, a simple event is an outcome that cannot be further broken down into simple components. So its example can be:<br />
Roll one die: 5 <strong>(simple event</strong>)<br />
Rolling one die has 6 simple events: 1, 2, â¦ 6<br />
Roll two dice: 7 <strong>(not a simple event)</strong><br />
Rolling two dice have 36 simple events: 1-1, 1-2,â¦.., 6-6, and 7 is NOT a simple event because it CAN BE broken down into simpler events, such as 3-4 or 6-1.</p>
<p><img src="../images/classification.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A classification Problem</p>
<p>2)Â <strong>Diagrammatic representation of text</strong> with proper labeling and caption containing enough description should be provided.<br />
e.g.</p>
<p><img src="../images/2a284-feedforwad_loop.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Molecular Biology of the Cell, Alberts</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Books should have <strong>analogies with the diagram</strong> in <strong>abundance</strong> to convert all abstract, new and tough concepts into concrete. It's an important feature, that makes a book exceptionally great and boosts learning</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Analogies can be misleading if it's not too close to the model you are explaining. Always provide contrasting characters of analogy in comparison to the real model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example of an analogy: Converting AC to DC</p>
<p>The converter uses a diode, a tiny electronic device that acts as a one-way valve to allow electron flow in one direction only. Since alternating current changes its direction each half-cycle, current passes through a diode only half of each period. The output is a rough dc, and it is off half the time. To maintain continuous current while smoothing the bumps, a capacitor is used. The capacitor acts as a storage reservoir for a charge.<br />

<p><img src="../images/4d302-analogy2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Conceptual Physics, by Paul G. Hewitt</p>
<p>4)After the text has explained a concept, it must give few questions on the particular concept in the same place. The questions should be prepared in a manner that, it checks the understanding of the concept, not just recall of the concept.<br />
5) Questions should be <strong>probing</strong>, also many questions should be <strong>graphics/diagrams with texts</strong>. Most books that are recommended usually don't contain visual questions. For example, if you look our books of biology, very less visual, and almost no probing questions are present, do compare with questions of Campbell Biology, Molecular Biology of the Cell, how they bring probing questions with visuals in them.</p>

<p>Question from Campbell Biology</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Length of the book should respect the time of students. It doesn't mean book can't be long or elaborative. Being elaborative is not about giving lots of different concepts or topics, it means explaining a few topics elaborately so that it requires least effort to grasp. A narrow but precise statement can take more time to comprehend than elaborative explanations with examples, images, and analogies.Â  Each sentence should have a purpose of being in the book.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't make it (the content) simple, teach the complexity by simplifying it. The curriculum should cover the depth of a concept and breadth of the subject without the clutter.</p>

<p><img src="../images/28ac0-c3eyufiwgaak3hn.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Questions and distractor in the case of MQCs should be very clear, that checks the comprehension, without creating confusion. Many times questions are written in a way that is just difficult to understand, you can't even know what the question is actually asking, so how can you even try to solve it even if you understood the concepts.</li>
<li>Each question in the textbook should have its purpose, <strong>problems shouldn't be designed just for the sake of doing it</strong>, it should <strong>improve</strong>Â the understanding of the concept at a deeper level, eliminate <strong>misconceptions</strong> and fix concept into memory.</li>

<p><em>Proteins carry oxygen in our blood, form antibodies that fight microbes, and even sense light inside our eyes â and each protein that makes up a human is manufactured in a ribosome inside our cells.
