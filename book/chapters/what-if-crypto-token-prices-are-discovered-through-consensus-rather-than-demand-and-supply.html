<p>âThe stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.â â Phillip Fisher</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scams involving cryptocurrency are extremely prevalent.
The majority of coins on the cryptocurrency market are worthless meme coins, but they nevertheless manage to dupe individuals into parting by enticing them to grow their money and making them rich in no time.
Crypto scams are currently not limited to big cities now they have even begun targeting underdeveloped villages in nations like India.</p>
<p>The issue is caused by the price being determined by the supply and demand of tokens on exchanges without considering their utility. The prices of tokens depend on how many people you manage to fool, and the scammer's ability to make a sudden spike through pump and dump.</p>
<p>Crypto scams, also negatively impact useful coins, and all currency prices move in sync, both good coins, and bad coins get dumped in a beer market.</p>
<h2 id="bad-money-drives-out-good-so-we-need-to-eliminate-the-bad-money"><a class="header" href="#bad-money-drives-out-good-so-we-need-to-eliminate-the-bad-money">Bad money drives out good, so we need to eliminate the bad money</a></h2>
<p>The price of tokens derived through demand and supply is suboptimal. It doesn't include a consensus from <a href="https://amiyatulu.github.io/blog/shivarthu/tyranny_of_the_majority.html">everyone or stakeholders</a>, but just the interacting party. So, they are free to produce as much as negative externality they like without any consequences.</p>
<p>Can we discover prices through consensus and using human rationality rather than speculation, increase stability of coins prices and curtail <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt">FUD</a>? There may be some way out.</p>
<p>The score schelling game can assist in determining cryptocurrency prices in decentralized exchanges by consensus and human reason.</p>
<p>The algorithm is provided in the following link:
<a href="./shivarthu/Shivarthu.html#price-discovery-of-positive-externality-through-score-schelling-game">Score schelling game</a></p>
<p>But setting an exchange using score schelling game is not without challenges. One of the problem is arbitrage. If the AMM price is lower than the market price, then people will drain all the liquidity and sell it at a higher price in the market. The solution can be the ability to withdraw after a month or have a KYC so that you can't withdraw tokens after certain limits.
Similarly, if the demand and utility of the token are more and the price is set lower, it can create a shortage, and more people will not be benefited, so, prices need to be increased through consensus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another way is to tax the shit coins and subsidize the good coins based on the price discovery, and this won't impact the liquidity or create the problem of arbitrage, neither KYC is needed.
Taxing can be done using market makers like Uniswap, and taxes collected are sold at lower discovered prices to buy or collect good coins and hence plummeting the shitcoin price and good coins collected are given as subsidies while exchanging the good coins . Liquidity providers can also be incentivized with tax collected.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rationality-disinformation-and-nudge"><a class="header" href="#rationality-disinformation-and-nudge"><strong>Rationality, Disinformation and Nudge</strong></a></h2>
<p>Only a nudge while buying from an exchange can work to many extents.
For example in real world, Adani stocks got plummeted by the Hindenburg report.</p>
<p>A decentralized cryptoexchange with <a href="https://amiyatulu.github.io/blog/shivarthu/tyranny_of_the_majority.html">a good governance</a> can provide a nudge for discovered prices, or provide research review and discussion about the advantages, disadvantages, security and application of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>An example nudge: "The price of the coin derived by decentralized experts is this. Do you want to buy the token at this price?"</p>
<p>We also need to have good institutes to stop disinformation by scammers. <a href="./what-do-we-need-to-decentralize-in-the-coming-years.html">Social media</a> are usually a good target for online fraud.</p>
<p>We can slowly increase the complexity of exchange with passing year that includes providing liquidity at predicted prices.</p>
<p><strong>An example exchange:</strong></p>
<p>Discovering price in crypto exchange using score Schelling game based on coin utility.</p>
<p>Bitcoin = 0.1
Ethereum = 0.4
Polkadot = 0.3
Near = 0.2</p>
<p>Exchange:</p>
<p>2 Near = 1 Ethereum</p>
<p>To calculate the price you need to take into account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Utility of the token (Most priority)</li>
<li>Total Supply of token</li>
<li>Inflation or deflation of token</li>
<li>Demand for token</li>
</ol>
<p>KYC of user, with limits to how much they can withdraw every day.</p>
<p>There can be incentives for providing liquidity, and the ability sale your token at the discovered price during the initial coin offering.</p>
<p>Price discovery every day or weekly.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-be-impact-of-other-exchanges"><a class="header" href="#what-will-be-impact-of-other-exchanges">What will be impact of other exchanges?</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://amiyatulu.github.io/blog/shivarthu/consensus_price_discovery.html">Details in the link.</a></p>
<h2 id="a-better-method-that-dont-require-kyc"><a class="header" href="#a-better-method-that-dont-require-kyc">A better method that don't require KYC</a></h2>
<p>The problem lies in whether sufficient liquidity is available. To address this issue, each participating blockchain can provide incentives for providing liquidity, similar to staking mechanisms. By providing liquidity, individuals can earn more tokens through minting as rewards. This incentivizes the creation of a steady pool of liquidity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this way, we can create an ecosystem of supply chains with more accurate price discovery, making money available to everyone in a fair and just manner. No more FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) or trading based on speculation rather than utility.</p>

<p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/waiting-for-altcoin-season-data-suggests-it-s-already-here">Waiting for altcoin season? Data suggests itâs already here</a></p>
<p>Every time Bitcoin dominance drops, analysts say altcoin season is coming. But data suggests that the altseason already came and went.</p>
<h3 id="1-concentration-of-capital-in-memecoins"><a class="header" href="#1-concentration-of-capital-in-memecoins">1. <strong>Concentration of Capital in Memecoins</strong></a></h3>
<p>Memecoins, such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and newer iterations like PEPE or WIF, often attract significant attention due to their viral nature, community-driven hype, and low entry costs. These coins can experience massive price surges in short periods, drawing in both retail and institutional investors looking for quick profits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Liquidity Shift</strong>: When investors allocate funds to memecoins, they are effectively pulling capital away from other altcoins. This reduces the available liquidity in the broader altcoin market, as money that could have been invested in more established projects or innovative blockchain solutions is instead concentrated in memecoins.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity Cost</strong>: The opportunity cost of investing in memecoins is high. Funds locked into speculative memecoins are not available to support other projects, potentially stifling innovation and growth in the broader crypto ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-speculative-behavior-and-market-sentiment"><a class="header" href="#2-speculative-behavior-and-market-sentiment">2. <strong>Speculative Behavior and Market Sentiment</strong></a></h3>
<p>Memecoins thrive on speculation and social media-driven FOMO (fear of missing out). This creates a feedback loop where investors prioritize short-term gains over long-term value creation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diversion of Attention</strong>: Memecoins often dominate headlines and social media discussions, overshadowing meaningful developments in the broader altcoin space. Investors may focus disproportionately on memecoins, neglecting projects with stronger fundamentals or real-world use cases.</li>
<li><strong>Volatility and Risk</strong>: The highly volatile nature of memecoins can lead to rapid inflows and outflows of liquidity. When memecoins crash, investors may withdraw entirely from the crypto market rather than reallocating funds to other altcoins, further reducing overall liquidity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-market-fragmentation"><a class="header" href="#3-market-fragmentation">3. <strong>Market Fragmentation</strong></a></h3>
<p>The proliferation of memecoins contributes to market fragmentation, where liquidity is spread thinly across thousands of tokens. This fragmentation has several implications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dilution of Liquidity</strong>: Instead of concentrating liquidity in a smaller number of high-quality projects, the crypto market becomes fragmented, with liquidity dispersed across countless memecoins. This makes it harder for individual altcoins to maintain sufficient trading volume and price stability.</li>
<li><strong>Barriers for New Projects</strong>: Established altcoins and emerging projects face increased competition for funding and attention. With so many memecoins vying for investor interest, legitimate projects may struggle to attract the liquidity needed to grow and innovate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-retail-investor-dominance"><a class="header" href="#4-retail-investor-dominance">4. <strong>Retail Investor Dominance</strong></a></h3>
<p>Memecoins tend to attract a large number of retail investors who may lack the sophistication or knowledge to evaluate the broader altcoin market. This demographic shift can have several effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-Term Focus</strong>: Retail investors are often more interested in quick profits than long-term investment strategies. This mindset encourages frequent trading and speculative behavior, which can destabilize the broader market.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Institutional Participation</strong>: Institutional investors, who typically seek stable and predictable markets, may be deterred by the volatility and unpredictability caused by memecoins. Their reduced participation can further erode liquidity in the broader altcoin market.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-regulatory-and-reputational-risks"><a class="header" href="#5-regulatory-and-reputational-risks">5. <strong>Regulatory and Reputational Risks</strong></a></h3>
<p>The rise of memecoins has drawn scrutiny from regulators and critics, who often view them as speculative bubbles or even scams. This negative perception can have ripple effects on the broader crypto market:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loss of Credibility</strong>: The association of cryptocurrencies with memecoins can damage the reputation of the entire industry, making it harder for legitimate projects to gain trust and attract investment.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Crackdowns</strong>: If regulators target memecoins due to concerns about fraud or market manipulation, the resulting uncertainty can lead to a liquidity crunch across the crypto market.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>In summary, memecoins can drain liquidity from the broader altcoin market by concentrating capital in speculative assets, diverting attention from meaningful projects, fragmenting the market, encouraging short-term behavior, and creating reputational risks. While memecoins can provide entertainment and opportunities for profit, their dominance may hinder the development of a more mature and sustainable crypto ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="key-idea-median-price-discovery-with-commit-and-reveal-scheme"><a class="header" href="#key-idea-median-price-discovery-with-commit-and-reveal-scheme"><strong>Key Idea: Median Price Discovery with Commit-and-Reveal Scheme</strong></a></h3>
<p>The core concept here is to use a <strong>median price discovery mechanism</strong> to determine the price of a token based on rational participants' inputs (e.g., bids and asks). A <strong>commit-and-reveal scheme</strong> ensures that participants cannot manipulate the process by observing others' actions before committing their own. Additionally, <strong>time locks</strong> and <strong>circuit breakers</strong> are used to prevent bulk arbitrage and drastic price changes.</p>
<p>Letâs examine each component:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="1-median-price-discovery"><a class="header" href="#1-median-price-discovery"><strong>1. Median Price Discovery</strong></a></h3>
<h4 id="how-it-works"><a class="header" href="#how-it-works"><strong>How It Works</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Participants submit their proposed prices for the token.</li>
<li>The system calculates the <strong>median price</strong> from these submissions, which becomes the reference price for trades.</li>
<li>This approach minimizes the influence of outliers (e.g., manipulative bids or asks) because the median is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="strengths"><a class="header" href="#strengths"><strong>Strengths</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resilience to Manipulation</strong>: The median reduces the impact of malicious actors submitting artificially high or low prices.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized Price Discovery</strong>: Multiple participants contribute to price determination, avoiding reliance on a single source.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="weaknesses"><a class="header" href="#weaknesses"><strong>Weaknesses</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationality Assumption</strong>: The system assumes that participants are rational and aim to provide accurate price estimates. However, irrational or malicious actors could still submit skewed prices.</li>
<li><strong>Low Participation Risk</strong>: If participation is low, the median may not reflect true market demand, leading to inefficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-commit-and-reveal-scheme"><a class="header" href="#2-commit-and-reveal-scheme"><strong>2. Commit-and-Reveal Scheme</strong></a></h3>
<h4 id="how-it-works-1"><a class="header" href="#how-it-works-1"><strong>How It Works</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Participants commit to their price submissions without revealing them publicly.</li>
<li>After a predefined period, participants reveal their committed prices.</li>
<li>The system then calculates the median price based on the revealed submissions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="strengths-1"><a class="header" href="#strengths-1"><strong>Strengths</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevents Front-Running</strong>: Since participants cannot see others' submissions during the commit phase, they cannot adjust their own submissions to manipulate the outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Fairness</strong>: All participants have an equal opportunity to influence the price discovery process.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="weaknesses-1"><a class="header" href="#weaknesses-1"><strong>Weaknesses</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: The commit-and-reveal process introduces additional steps, which may deter casual users.</li>
<li><strong>Coordination Overhead</strong>: Ensuring timely commitment and revelation requires coordination and trust in the system.</li>
<li><strong>Revelation Risks</strong>: If some participants fail to reveal their commitments, the process may become incomplete or biased.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-time-locks"><a class="header" href="#3-time-locks"><strong>3. Time Locks</strong></a></h3>
<h4 id="how-it-works-2"><a class="header" href="#how-it-works-2"><strong>How It Works</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Trades or price updates are locked for a specific time period (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour).</li>
<li>During this period, no new trades or price adjustments can occur.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="strengths-2"><a class="header" href="#strengths-2"><strong>Strengths</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduces Arbitrage Opportunities</strong>: By locking prices, you prevent rapid price swings caused by arbitrageurs exploiting discrepancies between your platform and external markets.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilizes Prices</strong>: Time locks give the market time to absorb information and stabilize.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="weaknesses-2"><a class="header" href="#weaknesses-2"><strong>Weaknesses</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced Liquidity</strong>: Time locks limit trading activity, which can reduce liquidity and increase slippage.</li>
<li><strong>User Frustration</strong>: Traders may find the delays inconvenient, especially if they need to react quickly to market conditions.</li>

<ul>
<li>If the price moves beyond a predefined threshold (e.g., Â±10% within a short period), trading is paused temporarily.</li>
<li>Once the circuit breaker is triggered, the system evaluates whether to resume trading or implement additional measures (e.g., recalculating the median price).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="strengths-3"><a class="header" href="#strengths-3"><strong>Strengths</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevents Flash Crashes</strong>: Circuit breakers protect against extreme price swings caused by large trades or arbitrage attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Promotes Stability</strong>: They give the market time to recover and reassess the situation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="weaknesses-3"><a class="header" href="#weaknesses-3"><strong>Weaknesses</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disruption</strong>: Frequent circuit breaker activations can disrupt trading and erode confidence in the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Threshold Sensitivity</strong>: Setting the right threshold is challenging. Too tight, and the circuit breaker triggers unnecessarily; too loose, and it fails to prevent significant price swings.</li>

<hr />
<h3 id="conclusion-2"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-2"><strong>Conclusion</strong></a></h3>
<p>Commit-and-reveal voting and rational price discovery can help <strong>reduce the prevalence of shitcoins or meme coins</strong> by introducing objective criteria and community-driven governance. However, these mechanisms cannot fully eliminate shitcoins due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, human psychology, and the ease of forking or trading elsewhere.</p>
<p>To maximize effectiveness, combine these mechanisms with other filters, incentives, and educational efforts. Ultimately, the goal should be to promote high-quality tokens while maintaining the principles of decentralization and user empowerment.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong>: <strong>Commit-and-reveal voting and rational price discovery can help reduce shitcoins but cannot fully eliminate them due to human psychology, decentralization, and speculative behavior. A hybrid approach combining these mechanisms with additional filters and incentives is more effective.</strong></p>
<h2 id="supply-chains"><a class="header" href="#supply-chains">Supply Chains</a></h2>
<p><strong>Different supply chains can be built with their own cryptocurrency.</strong></p>

<li>Governance with expertise that takes care of the whole system like setting taxes or subsidies.</li>
<li>No commission by the trade maker or app provider</li>
</ol>
<p>Subsidies cause more trade and can be wasteful due to deadweight loss if it's not a positive externality.</p>
<p>To enhance the platform, it is necessary to develop a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for shipment management, as well as a reputation system for both buyers and sellers.

</ol>
<p>Vertical farming offers several benefits compared to traditional agricultural methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Increased crop yield: Vertical farming maximizes the use of space by stacking plants vertically, allowing for multiple layers of cultivation. This approach can significantly increase crop yields per square meter of land compared to traditional farming methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient land use: Vertical farms can be built in urban areas, unused buildings, or even indoors, making them independent of arable land availability. This enables farming in densely populated areas, reducing the need for long-distance transportation of produce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Year-round cultivation: Vertical farming utilizes controlled environments, such as indoor facilities or greenhouses, which enable year-round cultivation regardless of external weather conditions. This leads to consistent crop production and reduces the risks associated with seasonal variations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water conservation: Vertical farming employs hydroponic or aeroponic systems that recycle and conserve water. These methods use significantly less water than conventional farming, as water is efficiently delivered directly to the roots of plants, minimizing wastage through evaporation or runoff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduction in pesticide use: The controlled environment of vertical farms reduces the risk of pest infestations, decreasing the need for chemical pesticides. Additionally, vertical farming systems often incorporate integrated pest management techniques and can employ natural predators to control pests effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy efficiency: Although vertical farms require energy for lighting, heating, and cooling, advancements in LED technology and energy management systems have made them more energy-efficient over time. Furthermore, renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, can be integrated into vertical farming systems, further reducing the carbon footprint. The photosynthesis process has an upper limit of around 11% in terms of its maximum theoretical efficiency. Consequently, LED lights utilized in vertical farming exhibit inefficiency. However, it remains possible to employ natural light/sunlight for vertical farming purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced transportation and logistics: By establishing vertical farms close to urban centers or directly within them, the distance between the farm and consumer is significantly reduced. This reduces the time and energy required for transportation, leading to fresher produce and lower carbon emissions associated with food transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced food security: Vertical farming can contribute to local food production, reducing dependence on long-distance imports and enhancing food security. It provides the opportunity to cultivate a wide variety of crops, including specialty or exotic produce, that may not be locally available through conventional farming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GMOs in Controlled Environments: The possibility of using GMOs exists in precision agriculture, such as precision vertical farming or hydroponics, where cultivation occurs in controlled environments without <a href="https://cban.ca/gmos/issues/environmental-impacts/">leakage into the surrounding environment</a>. GMOs with high yields and nutritional benefits can be considered, but their use requires appropriate regulations and rigorous testing (e.g. <a href="http://natureinstitute.org/nontarget/">Nontarget Effects of Genetic Manipulation</a>) to ensure their safety for human health. Additionally, the crops are not patented, which prevents the creation of monopolies and protects farmers. One example of GMOs involves producing genetically modified sugarcane or corn using aeroponics or hydroponics, and then utilizing them to <a href="https://grist.org/food/cooking-oil-deforestation-startup-sugarcane-solution/">produce vegetable oil with yeast</a>. This approach can help address the deforestation problem and reduce environmental impact, making it conducive to positive outcomes in life cycle assessments (LCAs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mitigation of environmental impact: By minimizing land use, conserving water, reducing pesticide usage, and optimizing energy consumption, vertical farming has the potential to mitigate some of the negative environmental impacts associated with conventional agriculture, such as deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational and research opportunities: Vertical farming serves as a platform for education, research, and innovation in agriculture and sustainable food production. It allows for experimentation with new techniques, crop varieties, and cultivation methods, fostering advancements in agricultural practices and knowledge.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While vertical farming has numerous benefits, it also faces challenges related to initial investment costs, energy consumption, and scalability. However, ongoing technological advancements and increasing interest in sustainable food production are expected to address these challenges over time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The high upfront costs of precision vertical farming, which amount to crores, pose a significant barrier for individuals to establish such operations. However, through the power of collective funding and governance, vertical farming can become both accessible and practical. One possible approach is to consider community investment, with each person contributing around $25 (which <a href="./empowering-communities-decentralizing-supermarkets-through-public-ownership-and-control.html">can be paid back in form of UBI or agricultural outputs</a>), to establish community-run vertical farming ventures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Privacy and large-scale computation are an important requirements for building decentralized supply chains. <a href="https://fleek.network/">New blockchains</a> and <a href="https://www.risczero.com/">zero knowledge proofs</a> are do made to solve these issues.</p>
