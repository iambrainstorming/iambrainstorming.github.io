Right-wing politics hold that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable.

**Some of the definition of social stratification:**

Social stratification is a kind of social differentiation whereby members of society are grouped into socioeconomic strata, based upon their occupation and income, wealth and social status, or derived power (social and political). As such, stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group, category, geographic region, or social unit.

In modern Western societies, social stratification is typically defined in terms of three social classes: (i) the upper class, (ii) the middle class, and (iii) the lower class; in turn, each class can be subdivided into strata, e.g. the upper-stratum, the middle-stratum, and the lower stratum. Moreover, a social stratum can be formed upon the bases of kinship, clan, tribe or caste, or all four.

**What Is a Hierarchical Society?**  
_[https://www.reference.com/world-view/hierarchical-society-d01aa58f1dd1ce6f](https://www.reference.com/world-view/hierarchical-society-d01aa58f1dd1ce6f)_

A hierarchical society involves two or more organisms working together to ensure their survival within a clearly defined stratified structure. In a hierarchical society, certain social positions and statuses have more prestige and importance than others. **_Hierarchical societies are not generally meritocracies, where people receive reward and status solely in response to their achievement_.** Hierarchical societies function with a "top dog" position that is protected and coveted.

**Here are some of the arguments in favour of Hierarchy.**

On the other hand, the idea of a purely egalitarian world in which there are no hierarchies at all would appear to be both unrealistic and unattractive. Nobody, on reflection, would want to eliminate all hierarchies, for we all benefit from the recognition that some people are more qualified than others to perform certain roles in society. We prefer to be treated by senior surgeons not medical students, get financial advice from professionals not interns. Good and permissible hierarchies are everywhere around us.

> **All articles have one thing in common, the proponent of hierarchies are confused between specialization and hierarchy.**

We prefer to be treated by senior surgeons because they are more specialized in the field. We want to be treated from an expert rather than a novice.

And that needn't have to be hierarchical.

Even though the job of both hierarchy and specialization is to direct, but they have an important distinction.

> **Specialization: I direct what I can direct.  
> Hierarchy: I direct what I direct.**

**Why hierarchies exist?**

As most mammals, the vast majority of primate species live in social groups. For the individual, the evolutionary basis of group living is enhanced protection against predation. But the intimacy of social life also brings with it increased competition for resources. Individuals compete with others in their social group for food, for example, by either scrambling to get to it first or else contesting others directly, which has led to the prevalence of dominance hierarchies as a way for both parties to avoid potentially damaging fights.

> But humans can avoid potentially damaging fights without hierarchies, and can have abundant food and security/safety for all humans through using algorithms.

Correct algorithms for democracy, economics, and education can make an equitable distribution of resources and power, with social well-being and peace, without any kind of discrimination, and can also check the population growth or other global and local problems.

> We have hierarchies in all components of society, whether its family, education or politics. This needs to change.

**P.S.  
**I am not against hierarchical algorithms in computer science. These algorithms can actually help to deal with social hierarchies.
