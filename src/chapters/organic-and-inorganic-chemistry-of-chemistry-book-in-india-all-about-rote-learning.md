Organic and Inorganic chemistry of Chemistry book in India: **All about rote learning**  
  
Most part of organic chemistry is all about remembering names and steps of reactions. It promotes VERY LITTLE comprehension of mechanisms and working of the reactions.  
  
Are these questions? Ridiculous

Please do compare the **content** and **questions** with international books such as **Chemistry: A Molecular Approach of Nivaldo J. Tro** for Inorganic and Organic part, and also **Organic Chemistry as a Second Language by David Klein**  
  
In organic and inorganic class, the teacher usually teaches the blackboard, not the students, because the content of the book is just about steps of reactions and alien names with no understanding.  
  
Please **design the syllabus and book** accordingly that makes organic and inorganic chemistry **interesting**, **increases curiosity** and promotes **comprehension and inquiry**.  
  
e.g. Do students know why carbon makes life, not silicon even if both can form 4 bonds?
