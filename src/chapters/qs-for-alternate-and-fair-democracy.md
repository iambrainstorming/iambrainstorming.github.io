**Probing Questions:**

Please read these before:  
**Overview of alternate democracy:**

**The whole process of voting in a DPoS Country:**

Q) **DPoS is better only if it can be implemented.  But I think it's difficult to implement.**  
A) NO, it's not, actually, it is a lot easier to implement.  
People can fill the voting sheets at home after analyzing the candidate's profile, and submit it in the polling day. No poll hacking as no possible incentives is present.  In the election, everyone will take an individual stand, so no support of political parties. So less pressure on Election Commission. Very little investment as compared to present election, as it eliminates the expenditure or corruption done by the political parties.

Q) **How nepotism is tackled in it? Giving election tickets to family members is common.**  
A) One needs to have expertise and relevance in the department in order to participate in the election. For example, if you are standing for the law department, you need to have studied about the law, maybe you are a lawyer or have worked under social justice, or you may be a psychologist or criminal psychologist, or you may be computer scientist interested in automating the law system, or you may be biotechnologist with forensic knowledge.  So, the chance of nepotism becomes negligible. Further, if you don't deliver,  people will remove you after 6 months, as all your work details will be available online and offline.

Q) **What about promotion practices through advertisement etc. or other unethical practice?**  
A) In order to promote themselves, there is no party backing, so it's not possible to spend a lot on the advertisement. It will be almost negligible to the amount spend now. Again by law, they can be denied for paid non-informative advertisement for self promotion, and they are very likely to be caught and fined or punished, as there is no political support to them. Also, here people are scientist or researchers in their field so they will be more ethical, and also, there are no benefits for them, for being unethical.

Q)**How can you make sure that frivolous voter doesn't cast their votes without knowing about the contributions of the candidates in a department?**  
A)Frivolous voters have no incentives to vote, not like present democracy, where political parties lure people to vote them. With frivolous voting, the department will suffer, so disincentives for the people to vote frivolously.  
But all the people should vote after analyzing the contributions of each representative of a department, and they can collaborate with experts to understand the impact of the contributions.

To make it further optimized, democracy can be run through blockchain voting using KYC, with proof of expertise of voters. A crash course about logic, reasoning, and departments can be given. Voters need to pass an easy test based on the course in order to vote for a department.

> Voting is a skill, just like driving which requires a driving license.

**Why democracy is unfair? An example.**  
If 6 members stand in an election and 1 member goes 50% votes and the rest get 10% each. The member with 50% votes wins and forms the govt. In other terms, 50% of people choose him while the other 50% didn't.  
Is it ok to choose him where half of the population didn't support him?  
What about when the rest 5 members make an alliance and want to form the government?

> Miserable democracy right? But in the given alternate democracy, you can remove an representative, just by giving 33% negative votes, even if 67% say ok. You can further decrease the threshold, with no problem, if not satisfied.

**How fragile democratic institutions can be in the face of an angry crowd, and leader willing to feed the anger and exploit the fear? Doesn't it still sound the same, regardless of how good or bad the party is?**

**Q) How much job opportunities fair democracy is to create?**

> _Fair democracy is meant to create more and more leaders with expertise._

  
With time more experts are made and it can go up to 200 to 500 experts representatives of all departments for every 10,000 people. _These jobs will never become obsolete, as these are critical thinking jobs that require careful human judgement and knowledge_. When we reach 200 to 500 experts for every 10,000, there will literally _no unemployment_.
