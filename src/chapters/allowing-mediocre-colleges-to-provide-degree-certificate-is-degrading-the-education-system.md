IITians, doctors, and most desired teachers try to join coaching institute instead of colleges.  
  
Reason:  
If you run a coaching institute, teachers are heavily paid, because about 70-80% of students money goes into the pocket of teachers, but no matter how much students pay to college, teachers are given fixed and very low salary. Also, brilliant students don't aim to join as a teacher, as pay scale is too low.  
  
Coaching institute business model works best to provide quality education as _teachers have the complete sole responsibility about their amount of income and autonomy to provide quality._ If teachers don't perform well, their pay scale will be low, so it creates a subconscious pressure to compete for quality**.** But this doesn't happen in schools or colleges.  
  
_How allowing mediocre colleges to provide degree certification creates a problem?_  
Allowing them to provide certificate enables them to bring students despite not providing quality.
