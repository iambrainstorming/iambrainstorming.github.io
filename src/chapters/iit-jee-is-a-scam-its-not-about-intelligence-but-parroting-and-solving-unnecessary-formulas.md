> In a usual physics book designed for IIT JEE preparation, each chapter contains an average of 50 complicated short cut formulas, and there are about 24 chapters, so in total there can be about 50\*24 = 1200 formulas. An almost impossible challenge to be memorized by an average student, which makes the entrance so hard to crack.

IIT JEE preparation is not about critical thinking, it's about remembering the formulas, and speed of executing the formulas.

This is the 2018 solved paper:  
Not a single seems to have without formula.

Please go through the book: [Paul Hewitt Conceptual Physics](https://www.amazon.in/Conceptual-Physics-Pearson-Paul-Hewitt/dp/9352861779/)  

> Each chapter contains not more than two to three important formulas, that's all required because all other short cut formulas are based on it.

An example question from the book of Paul Hewitt, that helps you to understand conceptual understanding, not executing complicated formulas:

Please go through the book, to know how the content and questions are designed.

Solving with formula without intuitive method makes student mindless.

Why are our books filled with unnecessary short cut formulas?

> Formulas are useful when you keep it as a reference, knowing that such formulas exist, knowing how it works and where it works is enough. It's analogous to a prebuild programming package or module where you can plug the values, and get the results during your research or experimentation in the lab. You need not have to keep the formulas in your memory.
