# Smartphones: An Evil Device Stealing Children's Childhood

## The Dark Side of Smartphones

The excessive use of smartphones can lead to significant neurological changes in children's developing brains. Research has found elevated levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brains of individuals with excessive smartphone use, resulting in poorer attention, control, and an increased tendency to be easily distracted. The constant flow of information and instant gratification provided by smartphones can also reduce children's attention spans and negatively impact their ability to focus. As children's brains are still developing, they are more susceptible to becoming dependent on the instant rewards and stimulation provided by these devices.

## Impact on Emotional and Social Development

The excessive use of smartphones can also disrupt the healthy emotional and social development of children. The constant connectivity and instant gratification provided by these devices can interfere with their ability to regulate emotions effectively. Excessive screen time can lead to irritability, mood swings, and even depression when children are unable to access their devices. Moreover, the virtual world can become a substitute for real-life interactions, hindering the development of essential social skills and empathy. The overreliance on smartphones may also contribute to a sense of isolation and loneliness, as children spend less time engaging in face-to-face interactions and forming meaningful connections with peers and family members.

## Brick Phones for children

While smartphones may have their drawbacks when it comes to children's use, it is important to recognize their utility in facilitating communication and ensuring children's safety. A viable alternative to consider is brick phones, which offer a simpler approach to communication. These basic devices prioritize voice calls and text messaging, eliminating the distractions and potential pitfalls associated with smartphones. Research consistently highlights the power of the human voice in fostering understanding and connection. By focusing on vocal communication, brick phones can provide a more intimate and meaningful interaction, allowing children to develop essential social skills without the distractions and potential risks of excessive screen time. This option strikes a balance between safety and healthy development, ensuring children can stay connected when needed while minimizing the negative impacts of excessive smartphone usage.

## The GI Joe Fallacy: knowing is not half the battle

While awareness of potential smartphone misuse is crucial, it is important to recognize that knowing about the issue is not enough to address it effectively—a phenomenon known as the "G.I. Joe Fallacy." Simply being informed about the potential dangers does not automatically lead to positive change. To truly protect children from the negative effects of smartphone overuse, we must take proactive steps and implement solutions. This involves educating both children and adults about healthy digital habits, setting boundaries and limits on screen time, and encouraging alternative activities that foster creativity, social interaction, and physical well-being. By taking action and not falling into the trap of the G.I. Joe Fallacy, we can ensure that smartphones become a positive tool in children's lives rather than a hindrance to their development.

## But technology can also aid in learning
 
We indeed need specialized, [high-security FOSS operating systems](../programming/foss_philosophy.md) for children, stripping out all social media and other potentially harmful modes of communication. This way, only beneficial and educational tools remain accessible. It is doable, but the dangerous influence of big tech lobbyists trying to take over the education system and invade our privacy and freedom must be stopped at all costs.

Software should not be under the power of a software developer who unilaterally makes decisions that nobody else can change. Educational institutions [should not allow proprietary software](https://www.gnu.org/education/edu-why.html) companies to impose their power on the rest of society and its future.
