#### ‘Reforms Of India’s Inheritance Laws Inadvertently Increased Female Foeticide And Deaths In Infancy’

From the 1970s onwards, changes in inheritance legislation sought to empower women by strengthening their financial and social position and reducing dependence on male relatives.

The traditional preference for sons was also supposed to lessen, because daughters, backed by possession of the family home, would be able to offer parents security in old age. Equally, this was expected to eradicate the dowry system, a key contributing factor to the perception of a daughter as a financial burden.

Instead, the **reforms appear to have had “unintended” effects leading to the “elimination of girls”**, as social norms that organise family structures and alliances have not kept pace with changes to the law, the study finds.

“Awarding inheritance rights to women makes parents more averse to having a daughter rather than a son,” the study says. _**This is because families fear that the cost of having a girl increases because property inherited by women risks falling into the control of her in-laws.**_

“In a dominantly agricultural household, the land is most important and comes before anything else,” Sen said. “_Parents would want to avoid splitting up the property, making it less productive, since the **only way of sharing** between siblings is **by selling the property** and distributing the proceeds._”  

**_The proportion of women inheriting property “did not increase significantly following the reform,” the study says._** Although laws now allow women to make legal claims to property, very few make such a move, which is **_perceived as anti-social and rebellious_**.  

“The family is a close knit-system, **_girls don’t want to go against parents and brothers and fight for property if they are denied it_**,” Radha Chellappa, child protection and gender advisor at the NGO Save The Children, told IndiaSpend**.** “**_The entire dowry system says that the daughters have already been given a share of the money, so they’re not entitled to the property_**.”
