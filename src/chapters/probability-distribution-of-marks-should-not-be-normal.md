**What type of variable is the mark, discrete or continuous?**  
Marks is a discrete random variable that has a finite number of values or a countable number of values.  
  
A continuous random variable has infinitely many values, and those values can be associated with measurements on a continuous scale in such a way that there are no gaps or interruptions.  
  
**Requirements for a Probability Distribution**  
1\. ΣP(x) = 1 where x assumes all possible values of marks  
2\. 0 ≤ P(x) ≤ 1 for every individual value of x  
  
For example, 2000 students gave exams with full marks of 10, the probability distribution of marks to have a normal like curve will have following frequency distribution given in the table.
