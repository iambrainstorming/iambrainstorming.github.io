# Why Web3 Must Be Taught in Schools and Colleges — And Why Politicians Should Pay Attention
*“Web3 is not just the future of the internet. It is the future of governance, finance, education, identity, and liberty.”*

### 🌐 What Is Web3?

Web3, often called the "decentralized web", represents a fundamental shift in how the internet works — moving from centralized platforms and intermediaries to systems where users control their data, identity, and destiny. If Web2 was about sharing, Web3 is about ownership.

Web3 combines **blockchain**, **cryptography**, **peer-to-peer protocols**, and **game theory** to empower users instead of platforms. It enables systems that are:

1. **Data Ownership:** Users control their data, not corporations.
2. **Privacy by Default:** Information is encrypted and pseudonymous, limiting mass surveillance.
3. **Decentralized:** No central authority can shut down the network.
4. **Decentralized Storage:** Data isn't stored on Amazon or Google servers — it's on distributed nodes.
5. **P2P Transactions:** Payments, messages, and actions flow without banks or middlemen.
6. **Trustless Systems:** Code, not corporations, ensures fairness and transparency.
7. **Game Theory-Based Incentives:** Networks reward honest participation and penalize bad actors.

## 🎓 Why Web3 Must Be in the Curriculum

**1. Web3 Will Touch Every Sector**
From finance and health to voting and social media, Web3 technologies are already being adopted. Teaching Web3 is no longer optional; it’s as essential as learning English or computers.

**2. National Innovation and Sovereignty**
Countries that educate their youth in Web3 will lead the next technological revolution. India, with its vast engineering talent, cannot afford to lag behind Silicon Valley or China in decentralized innovation.

**3. Economic Opportunity for Youth**
Web3 opens a global talent market. A 19-year-old in Bihar can contribute to a DAO, build a dApp, or launch a token economy — without ever leaving their hometown.

**4. Digital Rights and Political Empowerment**
Web3 literacy creates informed citizens who understand **digital ownership**, **free speech**, and **self-sovereign identity** — empowering movements, parties, and communities to organize better.

Political parties which campaign on transparency and decentralization, should be the first to advocate Web3 in education. It's aligned with their values — open governance, participatory democracy, and anti-corruption systems.

**5. Building Informed Citizens for the Web3 Age**
Blockchain literacy is essential to protect people from falling prey to scammers.
Even though most Web3 projects are open-source and transparent, many [naive users struggle to distinguish legitimate platforms from scams](https://interactive-five.vercel.app/crypto-disinformation). This vulnerability stems from a lack of understanding of cryptoeconomics and how decentralized systems function.

Since Web3 is community-driven, it's crucial for more people and developers to get involved.
Active participation ensures better self-regulation and allows the community to fully benefit from the technology—rather than being exposed to harmful practices.

## 🧠 What Should Be Taught in Web3?

Here’s a roadmap for a future-ready Web3 curriculum:

---

### 🦀 **Rust — The Language of Web3**

> “If you're not learning Rust, you're learning the past.”

Rust is fast, safe, and used by cutting-edge blockchains like **Polkadot**, **Solana**, **NEAR**, **Cosmos**, and **Internet Computer**. It has no garbage collector, uses an ownership model for memory safety, and is ideal for smart contract development.

### ⛓️ **Build Your Own Blockchain**

Understanding consensus, block production, and node interaction by **building a blockchain from scratch** gives students unmatched insight into the core logic of decentralization.

### 🔄  **Blockchain Algorithms**

Students should study:

* **Proof of Work (PoW)**
* **Proof of Stake (PoS)**
* **Delegated PoS (DPoS)**
* **Nominated PoS (NPoS)**
* **Chain Key Cryptography (ICP model)**

Each model shows tradeoffs in security, scalability, and decentralization.

### 🗳️ **Decentralized Voting Systems**

Introduce game-theory based, fair voting systems:

* **Approval Voting**
* **Quadratic Voting**
* **Conviction Voting** (used in DAOs)
* **Sequential Phragmén** (used in Polkadot elections)
* **Schelling Games**

These are essential not only for blockchains but for **governance, DAOs**, and even **political elections**.

### 🔐 **Cryptography & ZKPs**

Every Web3 engineer should understand:

* **Symmetric & Public-Key Cryptography**
* **Hash Functions (SHA256, Blake2)**
* **Post-Quantum Cryptography**
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**
  ZKPs allow a user to [prove knowledge without revealing the content](https://risczero.com/) — critical for privacy and scalability in blockchains like **Zcash**, **Mina**, and **Polygon zkEVM**.

### 🌍 **P2P Protocols**

Learn peer-to-peer (P2P) systems:

* **Iroh** — next-gen protocol for decentralized file sync.
* **BitTorrent / Rqbit**
* **Libp2p** — the P2P library of IPFS
* **Nostr** — open protocol for censorship-resistant communication

Also study:

* **Gossip Protocols**
* **DHTs (Distributed Hash Tables)**
* **Relay Networks**

### 🛡️ **Privacy Tech**

Web3 respects privacy. Teach:

* **Tor (via Rust's Arti crate)**
* **DNSCrypt**
* **I2P**
* **End-to-End Encryption (Matrix Protocol)**

Privacy education is key to safeguarding digital democracy.

### 🖥️ **Frontend in Rust: Tauri & Leptos**

Web3 apps need privacy-aware frontends. [**Tauri**](https://tauri.app/) + [**Leptos**](https://www.leptos.dev/) enables full-stack Rust apps that are memory-safe, performant, and small in size. Students can build secure dApps without relying on Google or Meta stacks.

 ### 🎲 Game Theory & Cryptoeconomics

Web3 systems are governed not by laws or police, but by economic incentives and mathematical rules. That’s where game theory and cryptoeconomics come in. Learning the [fundamentals of economics](https://mru.org/) along with cryptoeconomics is a must.

Students should learn:
- Nash Equilibrium and strategy design
- Mechanism Design for decentralized coordination
- Tokenomics — how to design and simulate token supply, demand, inflation, and utility
- Staking and Slashing mechanisms
- Mining/Validator Incentives
- DAO Treasury Allocation Models
- Fee Markets and their role in congestion control (e.g., EIP-1559)

Understanding why rational actors behave honestly in a trustless network is foundational to building robust blockchain systems. This knowledge also extends to building decentralized social networks, prediction markets, peer funding platforms, and digital cooperatives.

Game theory helps students not just build systems — but design systems that govern themselves.

## 🗳️ A Call to Politicians: Web3 is the New Literacy

Just like coding became a part of curricula two decades ago, **Web3 literacy** must be embedded today. Political parties — especially those championing digital rights and decentralization — have an obligation to lead this transformation.

Parties known for championing transparency and grassroots governance, can pilot **Web3 curriculum initiatives in schools and universities**. Not just coding classes — but **blockchain-based report cards**, **DAO-managed student bodies**, **decentralized scholarship systems** — can all be reality.

## Can Web3 Replace Web2?

Public-data–based applications can be decentralized or peer-to-peer, where all servers operate with equal power, or governed by fair reputation systems. With open-source software, anyone can run a node. Blockchain isn’t strictly required for decentralization, but it becomes valuable for building reputation systems, applying game theory, and enabling fair distribution of funds.

## What is a decentralized or peer-to-peer system in simple terms?

1. All servers (peers) have equal power.
2. The software is open-source.
3. Anyone can run a node or join the network.

However, when private data is involved, challenges emerge. Data analysis and AI that rely on sensitive information across multiple users are difficult to achieve in a fully decentralized manner. A possible alternative is something like the _fediverse_ for multi-user private data, but usability remains a challenge. In such models, your data could be managed by multiple system administrators or multisig-controlled nodes—an option that raises an important question: do you prefer your private data managed by a centralized entity or distributed across many semi-trusted parties?

User-friendliness in Web3 depends not only on engineering and design tricks. To bring users into Web3, we need to build user-friendly systems and also educate people. Teaching users the values of Web3 and FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) is essential for broader adoption.

## 🇮🇳 Web3 in India’s Curriculum: A National Imperative

If India wants to:

* Lead the **digital economy**
* Prevent **data colonization**
* Empower its **next billion minds**
* Create **digital infrastructure owned by citizens**
  ...then **Web3 education is not optional** — it's **inevitable**.

Let’s teach our students how to build the internet — not just use it.
