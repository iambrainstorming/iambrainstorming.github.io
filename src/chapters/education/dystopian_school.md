# A dystopian school: what does it look like?


## Schools where Students must be obedient

Schools often prioritize teaching students to be obedient, but disobedience has its own significance. While disobedience stemming from ignorance can be harmful, it also plays a crucial role in safeguarding democracy and handling authority's unfairness. As Dr. Gene Sharp notes in "The Politics of Nonviolent Action," "The most important single quality of any government, without which it would not exist, must be the obedience and submission of its subjects. Obedience is at the heart of political power."

The reason obedience is regarded as the ["heart of political power"](https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/resource/guide-effective-nonviolent-struggle-2/) is straightforward: if people refuse to obey, the ruler cannot maintain control. This insight is the foundation of strategies for nonviolent struggle. Nonviolent resistance methods, employed through actions and campaigns, aim to withdraw the support that people provide to those in power. By understanding the importance of disobedience, individuals can develop effective ways to challenge unjust authority and promote positive change.

Disobedience is important in every institution, as it allows individuals to challenge unfairness and corruption. Examples include fighting for equal pay, resisting exploitation of employees as wage slaves, protesting against institutions that harm society through environmental pollution, advocating for women's rights, and advocating for disability rights, among many other causes.


## Schools: Emotionally Unsafe for Students

Making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process. Errors, recognized and corrected, are essential for growth and understanding. In fact, research shows that mistakes are a crucial aspect of how our brains learn and develop. However, in many schools, mistakes are met with punishment or humiliation, creating an emotionally unsafe environment for students.

Although physical punishment is now illegal, many schools have turned to humiliation as a means of discipline. This approach can be just as damaging, eroding students' confidence and self-esteem.

Punishment or humiliation for mistakes, and making them high-stakes through grading, can inadvertently create a culture of fear, rather than fostering a love of learning.

Rather than punishing or humiliating students for mistakes, schools should focus on creating a safe and supportive environment where children feel encouraged to take risks, experiment, and learn from their errors. By doing so, we can help students develop a growth mindset, build resilience, and cultivate a lifelong love of learning.

### Children are not miniature adults

Children are not miniature adults, and it's unrealistic to expect them to behave as such. Yet, we often punish them for not meeting our adult expectations, forgetting that they are still learning and growing. But what if we let go of these expectations and allowed children to simply be children? What if we gave them the space to explore, to make mistakes, and to learn at their own pace? By doing so, we would be acknowledging that childhood is a unique and valuable stage of life, one that deserves to be cherished and respected. Let us allow children to remain children, with all their curiosity, energy, and wonder, and not try to rush them into adulthood before their time.

### Effective Behavior Management: Beyond Punishment

Maintaining high expectations of behavior for students is essential, but it's equally crucial to ensure that these expectations are realistic.How do you maintain good behavior? Is it through punishment, threats, or humiliation, or insult? Or should we use [evidence-based psychology](../relationships-emotions-and-happiness.md), such as cognitive behavioral therapy, to change behavior rather than resorting to negative ways.

This approach helps students develop the skills they need to manage their emotions and behaviors in a positive and constructive manner. By teaching children to be assertive, we empower them to express their feelings, ask for what they want, and say no to things they don't want. Assertiveness involves self-awareness, knowing what one wants, and communicating those wants in a respectful and clear manner. We shouldn't resort to mere obedience to authority, but rather about developing the skills to stand up for oneself and interact effectively with others.

Maintaining good behavior in students is a complex issue, and there are different approaches to achieve this goal. While punishment, threats, and humiliation may sometimes prompt immediate compliance, these methods can have negative long-term consequences. They can lead to anxiety, fear, and a lack of self-esteem in students, ultimately undermining their ability to develop healthy relationships and make responsible decisions.

On the other hand, incorporating evidence-based psychology like cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) into a behavioral management plan can be a more effective and sustainable approach. CBT helps students understand the underlying causes of their behavior and teaches them skills to manage their emotions and make better choices. By using this approach, educators can promote positive behavior, self-awareness, and self-regulation in students, ultimately fostering a more supportive and inclusive learning environment.

In essence, while punishment and negative reinforcement may provide short-term compliance, they do not address the root causes of behavior and may ultimately do more harm than good. In contrast, evidence-based methods like CBT offer a more constructive and long-term solution to maintaining good behavior in students.

## Discrimination between Toppers and Low Scorers: A Form of Social Stratification

Some schools perpetuate a form of social stratification by discriminating between high-achieving students (toppers) and low scorers. This can be seen in the practice of separating students into different classrooms based on their grades. However, it's essential to remember that success is not solely determined by intelligence quotient (IQ), but rather by grit and perseverance.

[Research has shown that grit is either unrelated to or inversely correlated with intelligence](../academics/grit.md), meaning that it's not necessarily the brightest students who achieve the most. Instead, it's the students who are willing to put in the effort and persist in the face of challenges who tend to succeed.

It's crucial that students of all abilities learn together and from each other, fostering a growth mindset and healthy companionship. This is because our social relationships have a profound impact on our moral compass and values. The company we keep can shape who we become and influence our behavior.

For example, if we surround ourselves with people who gossip and engage in mean-spirited behavior, we're more likely to become spiteful and cruel. On the other hand, if our friends are ambitious and supportive, we're more likely to dare to dream big. Similarly, if our friends value education and learning, we're more likely to prioritize these things as well.

### Gifted Children and CRISPR-baby scandal

Using terms like "gifted children" and separating them from others is a form of pseudoscience that bears an uncomfortable resemblance to eugenics and ["CRISPR-baby scandal"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00673-1). This approach can be seen as a form of racism, as it implies that some individuals are inherently superior to others based on their genetic makeup. However, human genetics is far more complex, and it operates on the principle of trade-offs. While an individual may excel in one area, this often comes at the expense of other important traits. In other words, being exceptionally good at one thing may be offset by weaknesses in other areas. By labeling children as "gifted," we are oversimplifying the complexities of human genetics and neglecting the fact that every individual has a unique set of strengths and weaknesses.

## Schools with No Coeducation: A Breeding Ground for Stereotypes

Schools that separate boys from girls are inadvertently perpetuating another form of social stratification, one that can have far-reaching consequences. By isolating boys from girls, these schools are creating an environment where stereotypes and misconceptions about the opposite sex can thrive. Boys and girls are denied the opportunity to interact, learn from, and understand each other, leading to a lack of empathy and mutual respect. This can ultimately contribute to a more gender-unequal society, where boys and girls grow up with preconceived notions and biases about each other. By segregating students by sex, schools are missing a critical opportunity to foster a culture of inclusivity, respect, and understanding, and instead, are inadvertently perpetuating the very stereotypes and biases that they should be working to dismantle.

## Schools that Teach to the Test

Many schools prioritize rote memorization and teaching to the test, rather than fostering critical thinking and creativity. This approach can lead to a narrow focus on standardized testing, where students are taught to regurgitate facts and formulas rather than think for themselves. As a result, students may excel in tests, but struggle to apply their knowledge in real-world situations. This type of education can also stifle curiosity and creativity, as students are not encouraged to ask questions, explore new ideas, or challenge the status quo. Furthermore, the emphasis on standardized testing can create a culture of stress and anxiety, where students feel pressured to perform well on tests rather than enjoying the learning process. By prioritizing rote memorization and teaching to the test, schools may be doing a disservice to their students, preparing them for a world that values conformity over creativity and innovation.

## Schools as More Than Just a Path to Social Mobility

In the relentless pursuit of success, we've reduced the purpose of schools to mere stepping stones for social mobility. The narrative goes: attend school, get good grades, secure a spot in a reputable college, and land a high-paying corporate or govt job. But is this narrow focus on career advancement truly the ultimate goal of education? Have we forgotten that schools can be so much more than just a means to a lucrative end? As David Graeber's book "Bullshit Jobs: A Theory" astutely points out, a significant portion of jobs in our society are meaningless and psychologically destructive, perpetuating a cycle of drudgery and dissatisfaction.

In a highly competitive and populous country like India, the current rate race system has dismal consequences. Less than 1% of the population clears the entrance exams, and a mere 0.1% are fortunate enough to have their names listed in the Employees' Provident Fund. This stark reality underscores the urgent need for an alternative economic model. The existing system is woefully inadequate, and it's imperative that we collectively rethink our approach to create a more inclusive and sustainable economic framework.

Schools are more than just a means to social mobility; they are vibrant hubs where individuals can flourish and become more well-rounded humans. Beyond the acquisition of skills, schools offer a unique opportunity for socialization, where students can interact with peers from diverse backgrounds, fostering empathy, understanding, and a sense of community. Moreover, schools provide a platform for gaining knowledge that transcends mere technical skills, allowing students to grasp the intricacies of how society functions from both macro and micro perspectives. Through education, students can develop a deeper understanding of the laws that govern our universe, the delicate balance of our biological ecosystem, and the complexities of human nature. As they navigate this journey of discovery, students can become more self-aware, cultivating a profound appreciation for the world and their place within it. Ultimately, schools can empower individuals to create a world that is truer to themselves and others, where authenticity, compassion, and wisdom reign supreme
