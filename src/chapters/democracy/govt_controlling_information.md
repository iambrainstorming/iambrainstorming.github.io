# How to share information under fascism or dictatorship?

## Story of Usha Mehta

## Explain how Usha Mehta used a transmitter to reach the voices of Congress and Gandhi

### Describe what to do when mainstream media is captured by a fascist government, and big tech social media either [censors content or reduces views that go against the government](../what-do-we-need-to-decentralize-in-the-coming-years.md#de-facebook-the-internet)

### How to use P2P technology (such as torrent, Signal, Tor network, VPN and many others) to access information?

Usha Mehta's use of a transmitter during the Indian independence movement is an inspiring example of how individuals can resist oppressive regimes and censorship by creating alternative channels of communication. Her actions provide insights into strategies that can be employed when mainstream media is controlled by a fascist government. In the modern context, P2P (peer-to-peer) technologies, such as torrent networks, Signal, and the Tor network, can be used to disseminate information and counter censorship.

#### Creating Underground Networks

Usha Mehta and her colleagues set up an underground radio station to transmit messages from the All India Congress Committee. In a similar vein, individuals today can create decentralized networks using P2P technologies. This can involve establishing alternative communication channels that are resistant to censorship and control.

#### Using P2P Technologies

- **Torrent Networks:** Torrents use a decentralized P2P protocol, making it difficult for authorities to control or shut down. Individuals can share information through torrent files, ensuring that the data is distributed across multiple users.
- **IPFS Networks**: Peer-to-peer content delivery network is built around the innovation of content addressing: store, retrieve, and locate data based on the fingerprint of its actual content rather than its name or location. 

Some of the IPFS storage system that are very easy to use includes:

<https://www.4everland.org>


- **Signal and other open source end to end encrypted apps:** Signal is an encrypted messaging app that prioritizes user privacy. Activists and individuals seeking to share information securely can use Signal for text, voice, and video communication without fear of surveillance. 

> You can find other apps in [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/). F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform. The client makes it easy to browse, install, and keep track of updates on your device.

Some of the other apps are Status, Briar.

> Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else who needs a safe, easy, and robust way to communicate. Unlike traditional messaging tools such as email, Twitter, or Telegram, Briar doesn't rely on a central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users's devices.

> If the Internet's down, briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the information flowing in a crisis. If the Internet's up, Briar can sync via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.


- **Tor Network:** The Tor network allows users to browse the internet anonymously by routing their traffic through a series of volunteer-operated servers. This can help individuals access and share information while bypassing government-imposed restrictions.

- **VPN:** [Opera Browser](https://www.opera.com) has a built-in free VPN, and there are other free VPNs available to install system-wide in F-Droid. 

#### Maintaining Anonymity

- **Operational Security (OpSec):** To avoid detection, Usha Mehta used to claim her radio station was broadcasting from "somewhere in India." Similarly, those using P2P technologies should prioritize operational security to keep their identities and locations concealed.

#### Resilience Against Jamming 

- **Decentralized Platforms:** P2P technologies inherently distribute information across multiple nodes, making it challenging for authorities to block or jam the communication. This resilience against interference is crucial in maintaining the flow of information.

#### Facing Arrest and Interrogation

- **Silent Resistance:** Usha Mehta's silence during six months of interrogation demonstrated a commitment to resisting oppressive forces. Similarly, individuals involved in P2P communication should be prepared for potential consequences and consider adopting silent resistance tactics to protect themselves and their networks.

#### Historical Inspiration

- **Learning from Past Movements:** Studying historical instances of resistance, such as Usha Mehta's efforts, can provide valuable lessons for modern activists. Understanding the strategies and challenges faced during historical movements can inform current tactics in the fight against censorship.

In summary, Usha Mehta's use of a transmitter during the Indian independence movement highlights the importance of decentralized communication in the face of censorship. Applying similar principles with modern P2P technologies can empower individuals to share information, resist oppression, and maintain the flow of crucial messages even in the most challenging circumstances.

## Usha Mehta and Congress Radio 42.34: Defying Oppression through Underground Transmission

Enters 22-year-old activist Usha Mehta. Along with some of her colleagues she found a transmitter and started an underground radio station. Congress Radio 42.34 thus began. It was on 14th August when this underground radio station began transmitting.

And the words you just heard were spoken by none other than Usha Mehta. Through this radio, the messages of the All India Congress Committee were broadcast to every corner of the country. Such underground media channels started opposing the propaganda of the British Raj.

To keep their location hidden,in her messages Usha Mehta used to say, "This is Congress Radio from somewhere in India.

But actually, she was operating from Bombay. It took the British government about 3 months to find the source of this radio.But by then, a lot of people were already aware. Gradually, All India Radio was called Anti-India Radio when they tried to jam the Congress radio. 

Finally, on 12th November 1942, the British government arrested Usha Mehta.All her equipment was seized and despite interrogating her for 6 months, she does not reveal anything to the British.

Later, in 1969, when she was interviewed, she said, 

>"When the press is gagged and all news banned, a transmitter certainly helps a good deal in furnishing the public with...spreading the message  of rebellion in the remotest corners of the country"
