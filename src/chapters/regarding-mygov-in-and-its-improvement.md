Here is an Idea:  
  
There should be an Idea sharing forum, and below which we can discuss our thoughts about a particular idea given, such as it is practical or not and what will be its effects on us, if implemented.  
There can be option for upvotes and downvotes. And repetition of Idea should not be allowed.   
Similarly, we can make a another subdomain for problem section i.e. people will share there problem faced which can be solved by government. People or experts can give suggestion or necessary steps to be taken by him.  
  
Similar type of framework is qoura/ stackoverflow. Please try to make a framework like that.  Also there are many open source frameworks like askbot which I like. It has also read only api, if we want to launch it on a native android app /or we can launch the website inside the app completely like the present Mygov app does.
