We always talk about महंगाई (price rise). But prices can't be decreased after a certain level. What is required is more people in production at the same price, so that people have more money in hand to spend.

It will not work in corporate companies and [unfair democracy](https://iambrainstorming.blogspot.com/2019/01/the-whole-process-of-voting-in-dpos.html), as they do the opposite. Less money in people hand and more money in owners hand.

Automation makes it more miserable, as only a few earn for production.

> Automation is supposed to improve the dignity of the worker by removing the mundane. But the paradox is it's doing the opposite due to concentration of money in few hands and lack of highly skilled and technical education among people.

It only decreases that prices, but don't much benefit to anyone other than the owner.

Automation with capitalism creates more miserable jobs, as even a semi-skilled employee will become jobless, and go for undignified jobs for making a cheap (having a low status and therefore not deserving respect) living.

**What Is a Bullshit Job?**

Here’s Graeber’s definition, which he constructs carefully over many pages: “**a bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.**”

**The bullshit job is about politics. Take for example automating sewage cleaning.**

It can act as a Cobra effect for manual scavengers due to automation.

Manual scavengers will lose the jobs due to automation, as a result, they will go on strike, and then they will act as a vote bank for opposition leaders. Then, the state government out of fear will revoke the large scale automation of sewage cleaning. The problem will remain unsolved as it was.

### **Form follows function**

> It’s a philosophy practiced in many industries. In architecture, this means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities that will be carried out inside them. For example, a skyscraper should be built with several elevator banks; a hospital should be built so that its emergency room is easily accessible.

But rather than worry about the “end of work,” we should be expanding the opportunities for human interactions within the framework of a new social economy._

Automatic tabletop dosa making machine  
But why aren't people using it in business?

Instead of people using and improving the automatic dosa making machine, people still sell dosa making manually, because these labor don't have money to buy these kinds of equipment, neither they have skills and knowledge about it.

It will also further worsen the employment of people in the fastfood industry.
