Do they site down the evidence in the news? Do evidence are from reliable sources with rigorous testing? Does the news show one-sided or biased views without looking at all angles? Is the information provided is an opinion/belief/viewpoint or hypothesis or scientific theory?

_**Opinion:** a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge._

Does the hypothesis/claim is well tested and is statistically significant to draw the conclusion?

Line by line scripts of news taking context into consideration must be analyzed along with bulk analysis by data scientists.

**The independent institute should open source the analysis to public so that it can be audited and reviewed by third parties. It should also come under RTI.**

**The institute will provide feedback to the media so that they can improve upon themselves.**
