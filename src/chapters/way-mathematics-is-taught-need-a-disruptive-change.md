**Mathematics needs a disruptive change, students who are not better problem solvers in all other fields are bad in it.**  
  
UNDERSTANDING how the calculation works is the most important step to test and analyze a problem.  
  
A most common problem with students who are scared of mathematics is not understanding how **fractions** work.  
  
What will happen if you divide a decimal number between 0 and 1 with 1000 and 10,000 etc?  
What will happen if you multiply it with 1000 and 10,000 etc.?  
What is the meaning of 1/3 \* 1/4? What is actually happening in it?  
How to divide a smaller number, for example, a decimal number between 0 and 1, Â with a bigger number? What are you actually doing in this way, how will you explain it with the example, such as a cake or tiles?  
How to subtract a decimal number between 0 and 1 with a number greater than one?  
  
Fractions are everywhere, you will find not a single field in which you will not find its (mathematics) application, whether you do physics, chemistry, biology, statistics, psychological studies, computer science, economics or any field.  
  
**Mathematics is not "all about memorizing rules", it's about understanding why and where the rules work.**  
**If you pay attention to understanding, a student will find mathematics more interesting and always try it to apply in real life situations. Memorizing rules are also taken cared of indirectly.**  
  
Need a disruptive change in how mathematics is taught in class, so that they understand why the rules work and what and where are its applications.
