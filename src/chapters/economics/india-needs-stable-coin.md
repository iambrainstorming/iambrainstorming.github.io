### Why India Needs Its Own Stablecoin?

Date: 25-10-2025

Russia has already warned that the U.S. is trying to exploit global crypto users to erase its **$35 trillion debt** by pushing **stablecoin adoption** (backed by U.S. Treasuries) â€” and then eventually **devaluing the dollar**.

However, the **RBI** seems to be taking a cautious stance. It wants to promote a **CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)**, but **democratic countries** are unlikely to allow such centralized control.
In fact, the U.S. has already passed **anti-CBDC legislation**.
The *Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act* (H.R. 1919), introduced by House Majority Whip **Tom Emmer (R-MN)**, was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on **July 17, 2025**, by a vote of **219â€“210**.
This law prohibits the **Federal Reserve** from issuing a CBDC directly or indirectly to individuals â€” preventing the Fed from becoming a retail bank with access to personal financial data.

### The Case for Public Stablecoins

What we need instead are **stablecoins issued on public blockchains**, such as **Ethereum** and **Solana**.

A **rupee-backed stablecoin** would bring in **foreign investment** and could become a **global digital currency**, ensuring that wealth generated through trade remains in India â€” unlike when we trade using the **U.S. dollar** or **dollar-backed stablecoins**.

India has a **massive labor force** that can benefit from global rupee-based trade rather than depending on the dollar.

### The Global Southâ€™s Labor Inequality

The **Global South** provides an astonishing **90% of the worldâ€™s labor** but receives only **21% of global income**.

)

Workers in the Global South â€” from farm laborers to scientists â€” power the world economy, yet face a massive **wage gap**.
The disparity cannot be explained simply by differences in skill levels. According to **Jason Hickel**, countries in the Global South supply the majority of labor across **all skill levels and sectors**, contributing **1,124 billion hours** of high-skilled labor in 2021, compared to only **971 billion hours** from the Global North.

Despite this, wages in the South remain **87% to 95% lower** for work of equivalent skill.

One explanation is **unequal exchange** â€” for instance, a southern worker may produce a smartphone component worth **$2**, while the final product, assembled and marketed in the North, sells for **$800**, capturing most of the value there.

Economists **Bettelheim** and **Palloix** argued that due to the **monopolistic control** of rich countries, they can sell goods **above market value**, while peripheral economies must sell **below production cost**, leading to a structural **transfer of value** from developing to developed nations.

However, unequal exchange is only part of the story.
If Southern labor is equally skilled, **why canâ€™t developing countries produce finished goods** instead of depending on the industrial North?

A key reason lies in **the dominance of the U.S. dollar**.
The U.S. exports inflation to other countries through the dollar â€” a currency **not backed by real assets** â€” and imports real goods and services in return.

### The Need for Stablecoin Diversity

India should promote not just a **rupee-pegged stablecoin**, but also **asset-backed cryptocurrencies** â€” for example, coins backed by **gold** or **silver**, secured through **government regulation**.

It is extremely difficult to build a trustworthy **precious metalâ€“backed crypto** without **state support**, but such coins can **stabilize the economy** and **hedge against inflation**.
With **government-backed gold and silver stablecoins**, money would remain **secure and transparent**, rather than being corrupted by private companies printing unregulated stablecoins.
