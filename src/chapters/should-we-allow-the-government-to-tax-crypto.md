Recently Indian government passed a bill with a 30% tax on profits on crypto trading.

**Using cryptocurrency doesn't mean tax avoidance**.  
Using cryptocurrency doesn't mean tax avoidance. We can tax with the in build algorithms of cryptocurrency.  
The reason for which we need tax collection is because of the tragedy of commons. People's self-interest doesn't allow funding of public goods that are free. People are likely to overuse public roads or public hospitals without paying for maintenance. That's the reason govt takes a cut and spends the money on public goods.

**Are government tax collection is optimal?** You can find many politicians and rich businessmen to evade tax through offshore accounts like Swiss banks away from country jurisdiction. It's always been a privilege for the rich to avoid taxes, where the burden of tax is left to the common people, despite 1% of the rich holding 90% of the wealth, furthering the income inequality.

**But are government spending of tax optimal?**  
If the government spends Rs 1, only about Rs. 0.1 reaches the people. Most money is taken by the middle man. And it's not surprising that govt spend Rs 4000 crore on advertisements to win election. More like, 80% funds on beti bachao beti padhao is used in ads. This is how they spend money. [India report Rs 5 trn of bank fraud](https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/banks-in-india-report-loan-fraud-worth-rs-5-trn-sbi-s-amount-largest-121052400494_1.html) and these are paid by people as taxes. With recent bank fraud discovered ([ABG Shipyard](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/the-abg-shipyard-scam-inaction-on-red-flags-as-indias-biggest-bank-fraud-unfolded/articleshow/89613817.cms)) with Rs 22,842 crores, India's biggest bank fraud. Not just that, [fiat money is used for criminal activities, terrorist funding and remain untraceable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/09/27/the-hidden-truth-behind-money-laundering-banks-and-cryptocurrency/?sh=7dbb03af7b37) unlike public transparent ledger of blockchain.

As govt can print any amount of money in central banks, it also funds for war during conflict bringing misery to the people but it's not possible with decentralized cryptocurrency. Take for example Russia attack on Ukraine or any war that has happened till now, from where does the money come from?

**Decentralized Tax, the New Alternative**  
We can have the optimal and programmatic distribution of money with game theory so that there is no tax evasion. Whether you are rich or poor you can't escape the algorithms. There is no such thing as bad loans in crypto, as all money are algorithmically distributed, so loan fraud are not possible with crypto.

Some examples are [Proof of Humanity](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/) which provides UBI to every person.  
Similarly, [Avrit Learning](https://avrit.reaudito.com/), a decentralized education system.

There are lots of experiments that are conducted worldwide for paying local police, homeless people, or hospitals.

Taxing on cryptocurrency by the government is a regressive step. It slows down the adoption of cryptocurrency and keeps you with the suboptimal parasitic government. If you trade or invest with crypto where will the money go? It will go to UBI, so that every citizen earns an income, it will go to the education where students earn for learning, and many other decentralized systems and decentralized supply chains that are present or yet to come.

There are many developed countries that keep cryptocurrency trading tax-free. Why is India which is even a developing country with a far lot of challenges the cryptocurrency solves be left behind? How can they even tax decentralized currencies? By turning the country into a surveillance state?

> It is not practical to tax crypto, due to privacy coin that uses technology like [zk-snarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0s4W3UBxM8) to anonymize transactions, so criminal and whales can easily evade the tax, it's the innocent and naive who can fall in the trap. Such disastrous tax law is only meant for stopping of innovation in web3 and investing in the future by building use cases like decentralizing governance and supply chains. Startup India and ArtmaNirbharBharat are just empty promises and marketing propaganda to earn votes. In reality, they want to stop innovation and want innovators to shift other countries and causing massive brain drain from India.

Privacy coins will obsolete income tax.

India is also launching its own digital currency. Mainstream media is doing rigorous campaign by counting its advantages. But it's not a cryptocurrency. Its anti-cryptocurrency.

> In reality, you should panic when central bank is bringing such programmable currency. It's going to be easy for the central bank to turn off any wallets they want to turn off, because of political issues or crime fighting or whatever. It will give complete control of citizen to government. A complete dictatorship like china.
