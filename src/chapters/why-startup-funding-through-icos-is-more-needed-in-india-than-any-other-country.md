Loan creates an immense burden on entrepreneurs as you have to repay it, and the condition becomes miserable if your idea fails with a large amount of loans.

Here in ICOs, people are stakeholders of the idea. So, if the idea doesn't support the interest of people, its unlikely to be funded. It's similar to the crowdfunding system.

How to tackle fraudulent ICOs?

What we need is an auditing system and return policy of cryptocurrency if your idea fails.

India needs an alternative source of funding for startups, and funding through ICOs is one of the best methods.
