They could have made it more structured, with the recommendation of open access contents (such as openstax) for each topic or whitelisting of content.  How much time does it take for experts? A month will be sufficient.  
  
It will also create demand for authors and publishers to meet the pedagogical need of students.  
  
There is a trade-off,  between adapting to the newly changed content and enhancing the quality of content.  But it could have been done slowly.  
If a new drugs work better than old drugs, the longer it takes to bring new drugs to market, the more people are harmed who could have benefited if the new drugs have been approved earlier.  
  
There is an opportunity cost (of a choice is the value of the opportunities lost) associated with the decision we make.
