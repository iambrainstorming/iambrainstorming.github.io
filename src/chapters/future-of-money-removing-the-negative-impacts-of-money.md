Just got an idea, we have two types of money, one required for short time for doing an exchange and other for storage.  
Name it: Exchange bitcoin and Storage bitcoin  
  
A centralized server (bitcoin bank) to generate bitcoin money who will keep track of money.  
  
Exchange bitcoins will come with an expiry date of one/two month. After bitcoins, are expired you have to reactivate your bitcoins from the centralized generator using your valid identity.  
  
In this way, money will remain accountable, can't be misused by anyway and money also can't be concentrated.  
  
Also, you can get bitcoins for storage (storage bitcoins), which can never be used to buy services or goods, you can get the storage bitcoins from bitcoin bank exchanging your exchange bitcoin. Storage bitcoins will be tagged with your identity, so you can't exchange it with anyone. Only you can exchange it through bitcoin bank to get exchange bitcoin.  
  
Also no chance of hacking, freedom of p2p exchange. No problems at all.  
  
What do you think about it?
