## Million Plastic bottles every minute

A million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute and the number will jump another 20% by 2021

Some key facts:

- Half of all plastics ever manufactured have been made in the last 15 years.

- Production increased exponentially, from 2.3 million tons in 1950 to 448 million tons by 2015. Production is expected to double by 2050.

- Every year, about 8 million tons of plastic waste escapes into the oceans from coastal nations. That’s the equivalent of setting five garbage bags full of trash on every foot of coastline around the world.

- Plastics often contain additives making them stronger, more flexible, and durable. But many of these additives can extend the life of products if they become litter, with some estimates ranging to at least 400 years to break down.

## Bring Back Refill

The report details Coca-Cola’s role in the rise and fall of the refillable glass bottle – exposing how the company knew that single-use plastic bottles were worse for the environment but doubled down on them all the same.

## Why we should move to tetrapack?

**Many layers**

Cartons are made mostly (about 75 per cent) from wood. Aseptic cartons (those that don’t need refrigeration) then use a layer of aluminium to preserve the product and layers of plastic to seal the container. Non-aseptic cartons (for fresh products with shorter shelf lives) don’t need aluminium.

'We always knew we were green and we thought it’d be obvious to everyone else since cartons come from trees,' he says.

### Scientific Evidence: LCA analysis

With consumers increasingly preferring scientific evidence to heart-felt assumptions, a number of LCAs have been produced over the last few years. A peer-reviewed study commissioned by Tetra Pak, which compared the Tetra Recart (the name of the tomato container) and steel cans, provided stark results: steel cans use twice as much energy during their life cycle as cartons, they produce 2.5 times more waste and more than three times the amount of CO2 emissions.

## Will tetrapack lead to more cutting of trees?

One need to grow more bamboos.

The environmental benefits:

    Renewable – Bamboo grows rapidly. It’s an abundant renewable resource, making it an ideal, eco-friendly alternative to traditional paper products.

    Biodegradable & Compostable – Bamboo is biodegradable and 100% compostable within 2–6 months, depending on your specific product and composting conditions.

    Carbon footprint – Bamboo releases 35% more oxygen into the atmosphere than the same volume of trees. By supporting the bamboo market, you’re supporting the continued carbon emission reduction caused by bamboo plants.

## Coca cola says they will lose customer if they move away from plastic bottles

**To bring the change, its needs political movement, there is enough corporate lobby, fossil fuel industries like Ambani are the supplier of plastic, coca cola says they will lose customer if they move away from plastic bottles.** 

> **RIL (Reliance Industries Limited), one of world’s largest producers of single-use plastics.**

Through cultivation of bamboos, farmers will be benefited rather than Ambanis, also you are protecting the environment by planting more carbon neutral trees.
