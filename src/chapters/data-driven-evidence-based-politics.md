How politician should work in India, in order to make the country successful?

Do political party work based upon their hypothesis, or use unbiased data to make decisions?  
  
Recent data shows that, while voting for a particular party, people are more interested in the main leader (CM or PM) who will lead the state or country and does not much depend upon who are MLAs and MPs  
  
But are political parties working in creating new leaders with value?  
Most of the time, a party lose an election is due to lack of a proper competitive leader in opposition.  
Proper examples would be Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal etc. Even though they are/were low-performing states, the opposition lost the election. Common people without political background does not even notice who were the leader in opposition. In Bihar, BJP tried to highlight Modi, but people are not giving votes to Modi, they are giving the vote to the state leader. So why don't the opposition spent most of its energy in highlighting the main leader to whom people will vote, who is the one who will listen to the people.  
  
What are the requirements of creating new leader?  
First, he/she has to make public contact, listen to problems of the people and finding the most appropriate solutions for them.  
Creating a new leader is just like Entrepreneurship who are in a startup and want to sell their ideas and solutions. So a leader must learn how to build a successful startup.  
Edx.org, Udacity ( Continue How to Build a Startup? https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ep245)  
  
  
A successful leader should be a person of value rather than a person of success.  
  
Importance of Team Work  
People may choose to vote based upon the main leader. But the ground reality is the team work of the party. Without a proper team work, NOTHING IS POSSIBLE.  A leader will also not become a leader without a proper team work.  
  
So, how a party as a team should work before elections?  
Most important thing is reaching the people.  
In Entrepreneurship, it's called Channel. What is the channel you need to take to reach people?  
1) Social Media  
It's a wonderful tool to reach people who are middle class and upper class. You can ask for feedback, suggestions, their problems. Then find solutions to the problems by asking experts. Then tell the people what solutions you have and what you are going to do when you win elections.  
Few middle-class people don't use internet connection, so tell them to use social network sites like twitter, tell them you are on social network sites, where you will be available, and allow them to provide feedback. Reach students and young generation as much as possible. They are the most decisive force in the election. Ask for their problems, what solution you are going to bring.  
2) Telephone  
A great chunk of people are poor/illiterate without an internet connection, so they are not aware of social media. Here telephone comes into the picture. Give them your number, ask them to vote for by giving missed calls (remember successful strategies applied by Aravind Kejriwal), ask them to SMS their problems, tell them what solution you will bring when you win.  
3) Reaching through going to their homes.  
Even though it's not practical to reach every ones home by a single person, but as a team, its possible. But don't go to ask for votes, ask for their problems, make a questionnaire section with asking very right questions such as, what are there needs, what do they expect from political parties, what present govt has not done for them, what solution you will bring to them. So make a list of such questions and answers, save them and analyse them with a computer. Keep as much as data with you. This will also help to attack the govt, find the faults of the govt., and even the govt. can't deny it if the data is accurate. Also, highlight what solutions you will bring after winning the election.  
It's a trend of political parties that, they go to people's home only a day before the election. They just forget people after the election. Imagine, if political parties come to people home after winning the election for thanks giving. How the feeling of positive psychology will be brought among the people?  
  
So, after winning the election, continue with the channel again. Its time for delivery. Just fulfill your promise.  
  
If parties follow this path, success comes for sure because you are following evidence to make proper decisions, if not successful, you will not be in guilt that, you have not tried your best because following this path will not only improve your party but also the party in power, so there will be a healthy competition.  
  
  
But never choose a decision that is against the public interest, even if its right for your party to win the election.  
  
Here are some of the random views, that a good leader should have:  
  
Allowing diversity of views  
Thinking in all angles  
Proactive  
Allow feedback and give feedback  
Finding solutions to the problem rather than getting trapped in the problem  
Accept the fault and work for improvement rather than in denial  
Encourage constructive criticism  
Live with people with diversified background, so that there is a mutualistic relationship  
Handle social media  
Use of technology  
Become logical, no one can challenge a logical statement.  
Bring the right issues, so that nobody can deny accepting.  
Become a critical thinker and reader of research based articles and solutions, its most important, a leader should be a process of learning all the time, so keep a chunk of time to read the things that can bring big solutions to the problems.  
Dispose of the controversies as early as possible  
  
  
  
Here are some of the other courses that a leader must work on:  
  
The Complete Guide to Memory Mastery, Harry Lorayne  
Even though its a memory book, but gives proven techniques such as  
Strengthen good habits and discard bad ones, Improve your powers of observation, Deliver a speech without fear, Become more organized and time-efficient, Logical thinking etc.  
Edx course on Philosophy and Critical Thinking, Justice, Framing: How Politicians Debate  
  
Even though such a process was unimaginable before, but thanks to BJP and AAP for bringing optimism in the country.
