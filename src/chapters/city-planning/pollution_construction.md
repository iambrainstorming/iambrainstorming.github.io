# Air pollution due to construction

## Draft


In construction zones, a notable source of pollution is found, which includes air, water, noise, and soil pollution, affecting nearby homes, businesses, and residents. The construction sector is a significant contributor to pollution, with the United States showing that it accounts for 

- 23% of air pollution
- 40% of drinking water pollution, 
- 50% of pollution related to climate change, and 
- 50% of the environmental pollution from landfills.

In London, construction contributes to 30% of PM10 emissions, 8% of PM2.5 emissions, and 4% of nitrous oxide emissions, according to the 2019 London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory. 

Furthermore, construction activities account for 25-40% of the world's carbon emissions, highlighting its impact on climate change. Additionally, the construction sector in the U.K. uses over 400 million tons of material annually, generating a large amount of waste.
