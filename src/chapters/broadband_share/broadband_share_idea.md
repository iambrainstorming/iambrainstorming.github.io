# Decentralized Blockchain Based Network 

Can an incentive system be built for a mesh network? How can payments be made to service provider by users who use Wi-Fi over the internet? One could create a smart contract for each Wi-Fi router, where people pay in tokens (perhaps including USDT) to access the internet."


One can use wireless bridge to expand the network, 20KM: [Outdoor Wireless Bridge](https://www.amazon.in/20-11ac-Outdoor-Wireless-Bridge/dp/B084DKMWPB/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1TS5L8K8QI9ZS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.emYyaG6gf0TdpUbCO5D8aTDewobwH9JHbtB-VABf52awP0zH7pOJabjGUj5SCL7vf-E1pA2A3Iw908YQTwub66WLNlbca7sqQgXCF3hSjxoQ0MLltmzcAy7IgEyhR6rcRMcUuJ_RKaLSRX0diqZ2wg._JKz9RGogW7erEuk53vTX9r5Xm6cX44ptJWgDfLF8xg&dib_tag=se&keywords=10+km+wifi+AC+bridges&qid=1708235044&sprefix=10+km+wifi+ac+bridge%2Caps%2C319&sr=8-3)

## For creating accounts of users and network broadband tracking

### Use freeRADIUS

User id can be the crypto public key.

One can use raspberry pi zero as server.

[Data usage reporting](https://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/Data-Usage-Reporting)

## Get the broadband statistics, upload it to blockchain, every day

Parse the braodband statistics, and upload it to blockchain

Two types of account:

    1) Service provider
   
    2) Service User


## Transfer the funds from the user to the service provider based on statistics

It is a prepaid system. Users can switch service providers within a day. This helps promote competition and eliminates fraudulent or non-reliable service providers.


More reliable mesh network where service provider can also become user, in case of network failure of service provider. 

Voting by [Schelling game](../shivarthu/Shivarthu.html) evaluates its connectivity, speed, and coverage every month. Disapproval may result in slashing. Good and authentic service means no slashing occurs.

## Other incentives

In addition, other incentives, such as staking to gain interest, rewards for providing reliable service, and bonuses for registering for the service, can be provided.

## Including LoRaWAN along with short range high speed WiFi

LoRaWAN, a low-power wide-area networking (LPWAN) technology, can play a crucial role in maintaining internet connectivity and enabling critical communication.

Key Advantages:

- Long-range capability: LoRaWANâ€™s ability to transmit data over long distances (up to 10 km) makes it suitable for use in areas where traditional infrastructure is damaged or non-existent.
- Low power consumption: LoRaWAN devices consume very low power, allowing them to operate for extended periods on battery power or even using energy harvesting techniques.
- Affordability: LoRaWAN devices and gateways are relatively inexpensive, making them a cost-effective solution for deploying emergency communication networks.
- Scalability: LoRaWAN networks can be easily scaled up or down depending on the needs of the situation, allowing for flexible deployment in response to changing circumstances.

Use Cases:

- Emergency response: LoRaWAN can be used to establish communication networks for emergency responders, enabling them to coordinate efforts and share critical information.
- Infrastructure monitoring: LoRaWAN sensors can be deployed to monitor the status of critical infrastructure, such as bridges, dams, or power grids, providing early warning systems for potential failures.
- Disaster relief: LoRaWAN can facilitate communication between relief organizations, aid distribution centers, and affected communities, helping to coordinate relief efforts and ensure timely delivery of aid.
- Authoritarian government censorship: LoRaWAN technology could be used in regions with strict internet censorship to establish decentralized and alternative networks, allowing citizens to communicate and access information without being monitored or restricted by the government.
- Resilient connectivity: LoRaWAN can also act as a bridge between short-range decentralized local Wi-Fi networks and the global network, providing an alternative means of connectivity in the event that centralized high-speed corporate internet connections are disrupted or shut down by an authoritarian government. This can help maintain high-speed connectivity and facilitate the exchange of critical information locally, also spreading it to global network steadily.

P.S.

Satellite internet services like Starlink are not a solution; in fact, they would likely be the first to be censored due to their fully centralized nature. Its also a threat to the national security for many countries, as it give so much power to single person.
