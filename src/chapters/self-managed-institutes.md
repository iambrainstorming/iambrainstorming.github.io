# When do self-managed institutes work?


While self-management offers numerous benefits, such as increased flexibility and employee satisfaction, it also presents unique challenges, particularly in a remote work environment. In this article, we explore the importance of leadership in guiding self-managed teams and ensuring productivity and cohesion.


Self-management entails entrusting employees with the responsibility to organize and execute their tasks independently, without [constant supervision or micromanagement](./micromanagement.md). However, this autonomy can lead to disarray, especially when employees are working from home. Without the structure of a traditional office setting and the presence of colleagues and supervisors, workers may struggle to stay focused and meet deadlines.

One of the key roles of a leader in a self-managed institute is to provide guidance and support to employees, helping them navigate the challenges of remote work and stay on track. While it's not about micromanaging every aspect of their work, leaders can employ strategies such as nudge theory to subtly influence behavior and encourage productivity.

[Nudge theory](./reasoning/fallacies.md#nudge-theory), popularized by behavioral economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, suggests that small, positive reinforcements or gentle reminders can lead to significant changes in behavior. In the context of self-managed teams, leaders can use intermittent feedback sessions to provide guidance, address concerns, and keep employees motivated. These sessions, held every hour or two, serve as checkpoints to assess progress, offer assistance, and ensure alignment with organizational goals.

For example, in an economics class, a teacher might begin by [summarizing or explaining a video lesson](https://mru.org/courses/principles-economics-microeconomics/introduction-microeconomics). Then, they can ask the students to engage in retrieval practice for 45 minutes. After this period, the teacher can provide feedback, clarify any doubts, and answer questions for 15 minutes.


Also, one can set up local community centers for individuals to sit and work remotely, especially in cases where the home environment might not be suitable, [particularly for working women](./rethinking-work-culture.md#challenges-of-working-from-home-for-women-in-india-caregiving-and-the-patriarchal-system).


Furthermore, the success of self-managed institutes hinges on the presence of effective leaders who possess strong leadership qualities and self-control. Identifying individuals with these attributes and entrusting them with leadership roles is crucial for the smooth functioning of self-managed teams. Leaders who can inspire and motivate their team members, maintain discipline, foster a culture of collaboration, and have the necessary skills to [evaluate evidence to determine what works and what does not](./reasoning/evidence-based_medicine.md), are invaluable assets in a self-managed environment.
