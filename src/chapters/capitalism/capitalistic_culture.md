# Shift in Capitalistic Culture: From Independence to Corporate Dependency

The evolution of capitalist culture has brought about profound changes in the way societies function, particularly in the transition from self-sufficiency to corporate dependency. This shift has not only altered economic structures but also deeply impacted familial and social dynamics. The contrast between the lives of earlier generations and the present generation is stark, revealing a transformation from independence to a reliance on corporations for survival and progress.

### The Independent Past: A Self-Sufficient Lifestyle

In the past, families lived a largely self-sufficient lifestyle. Early generations were not burdened by the anxieties that plague modern parents. It was common for families to have as many as ten children, yet parents remained relatively carefree about their children’s future. This was largely due to the fact that households were economically independent. Every home had its own means of sustenance: families grew their own food, kept cows for milk, cultivated rice, and grew vegetables in their backyards. Children attended government schools, eliminating the need for expensive private education. Parents did not feel the pressure to secure high-paying jobs to provide for their families, as their basic needs were met through their own labor and resources.

This independence extended beyond just food production. Communities were tightly knit, and barter systems often supplemented monetary transactions. Skills like carpentry, weaving, and farming were passed down through generations, ensuring that families could sustain themselves without relying on external entities. Life was simpler, and while it may have lacked the conveniences of modern technology, it was marked by a sense of autonomy and security.

### The Rise of Corporatization: A Shift to Dependency

The advent of corporatization has fundamentally altered this way of life. Today, families with just one or two children are riddled with anxiety about their future. While the reduction in family size has helped control population growth, it has also intensified the pressure on parents to ensure their children’s success in an increasingly competitive world. Questions like, “Will they get a job?” or “Can they make a living when they grow up?” dominate the minds of modern parents.

So, what has changed? The answer lies in the shift from self-sufficiency to corporate dependency. With the rise of corporations, individuals have become job seekers rather than creators of their own livelihoods. The once self-reliant households now depend on corporations for employment, food, education, and even entertainment. This dependency has led to a mass migration from rural areas to cities, as people seek jobs in urban centers. Villages have been left empty, while cities have become overcrowded, polluted, and marked by stark economic disparities.

### The Urbanization Paradox: Pollution, Slums, and Exploitation

The migration to cities has created a paradox. On one hand, cities are seen as hubs of opportunity, offering better jobs, education, and healthcare. On the other hand, they have become breeding grounds for pollution, slums, and exploitation. The normalization of pollution in densely populated urban areas is a testament to the environmental cost of this shift. Slums have emerged within cities, housing those below the poverty line who are unable to afford proper living conditions.

This urbanization has also given rise to a hierarchical system of exploitation. The lower class, comprising laborers like fishermen, plumbers, electricians, and construction workers, zomato guy for food delivery, ola auto driver are often exploited by the middle class. The middle class, which includes white-collar workers employed in corporate offices, who spend their workdays sitting in front of computers is in turn exploited by large corporations. These corporations, owned by the elite—shopping mall owners, tech giants like Google and Facebook, telecom companies like Jio, port owners, and real estate moguls—wield immense power over the economy and the lives of individuals.

### The Psychological and Social Impact

The shift from independence to corporate dependency has not only economic but also psychological and social implications. The pressure to secure a stable job and provide for a family in a competitive environment has led to increased stress and anxiety among parents. The fear of unemployment and the rising cost of living have made life more precarious. Children, too, are burdened with the expectation to excel academically and professionally, often at the cost of their mental well-being.

Moreover, the erosion of self-sufficiency has weakened community bonds. In the past, communities worked together to meet their needs, fostering a sense of solidarity. Today, the individualistic nature of corporate culture has led to a decline in communal support systems. People are more isolated, and the sense of belonging that once characterized rural life has diminished.

### Conclusion:

**Can automation, cryptocurrency, peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized cloud, Web3, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and free and open-source software (FOSS) restore the self-reliance we once had?**

It is possible, but it requires us to redesign and rethink the system entirely. We need to reclaim community control from corporations. Today, we have all the necessary tools, which continue to evolve, but the question remains: Can we envision and build a different future?
