Effects of domestic violence on children, result from witnessing domestic violence in a home where one of their parents are abusing the other parent, _**plays a tremendous role on the well-being and developmental growth of children witnessing the violence**_.

Children who witness domestic violence in the home often believe that they are to blame, **live in a constant state of fear** and are 15 times more likely to be victims of child abuse.

Close observation during an interaction can alert providers to the need for further investigation and intervention, such **as dysfunctions in the physical, behavioral, emotional, and social areas of life**, and can aid in early intervention and assistance for child victims.

The physical effects of domestic violence on children, **different than the effects of direct abuse, can start when they are fetus in their mother's womb**, can result in low infant birth weights, premature birth, excessive bleeding, and fetal death, due to the mother's physical trauma and emotional stress. Increased maternal stress during the times of abuse, especially when combined with smoking and drug abuse, can also lead to premature deliveries and low weight babies.When a woman is stressed while pregnant, the baby can be born with stress and anxiety and can sometimes have problems with growth.

Older children can sometimes turn the stress towards behavioral problems. Sometimes children who see the abuse turn to drugs, hoping to take the pain away. The children, however, will exhibit physical symptoms associated with their behavioral or emotional problems, such as being _withdrawn from those around them, becoming non-verbal, and exhibiting regressed behaviors such as being clingy and whiney_. Anxiety often accompanies a physical symptom in children who witness domestic violence in the home. If their anxiety progresses to more physical symptoms, they may show signs of tiredness from lack of sleep and weight and nutritional changes from poor eating habits.

> Children may think that violence is an acceptable behavior of intimate relationships and become either the abused or the abuser.

An estimated 1/5 to 1/3 of teenagers subject to viewing domestic violent situations experience teen dating violence, regularly abusing or being abused by their partners verbally, mentally, emotionally, sexually or physically. 30% to 50% of dating relationships can exhibit the same cycle of escalating violence in their marital relationships.

Children exposed to violence in their home often have conflicting feelings towards their parents; **For instance, distrust and affection often coexist for the abuser.** _The child becomes overprotective of the victim and feels sorry for them._

They often develop anxiety, fearing that they may be injured or abandoned, that the child's parent being abused will be injured, or that they are to blame for the violence that is occurring in their homes.

> Grief, shame, and low self-esteem are common emotions that children exposed to domestic violence experience

> Depression is a common problem for children who experience domestic violence. The child often feels helpless and powerless. More girls internalize their emotions and show signs of depression than boys. Boys are more apt to act out with aggression and hostility.

Witnessing violence in the home can give the child the idea that **nothing is safe in the world and that they are not worth being kept safe which contributes to their feelings of low self-worth and depression.**
