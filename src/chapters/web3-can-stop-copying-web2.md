With the advent of high-speed internet, we consume a ton of information every day. From teenagers to adults, we all use social media to communicate but are they quality information for your sound decision-making or just information pollution that causes loss of perspective and moral values.  
Take Twitter, for example, some content of Twitter is trolls, abuses, or fake information but another problem that remains, the problem of redundancy and low-quality information.

Is there any solution to it?  
Maybe incentivizing high-quality information is a solution. It can create a self-reinforcement pattern to share good quality content. Information from StackOverflow or Wikipedia is still a lot, you just visit some 0.1% of the content but whatever you visit is of good quality. Though comparing Twitter and StackOverflow are like apples and oranges, but both are run by the community. It's the incentive algorithms that keep bad information at bay.

Twitter is the place to share your blogs, news, and ideas, Facebook is another fake news propaganda engine but its value lies in connecting close friends with photos. It's a good idea to share photos once in a while, but doing that daily and seeking comments and approval can produce anxiety.

What about addictive funny ticktock videos or youtube shorts, how much are they harmful? Some evidence suggests that celebrity content are harmful to girl teens and they don't feel good about their body. Video games, another problem. Gamers spend hours streaming their video games on youtube. Sadly, we have built algorithms, where gamers have the highest number of followers than any quality information provider. We can find kids spending most of the time scrolling on shorts, wasting a lot of time, which could be used in self-improvement, learning, and exercises.

Currently, apps are trying to be a jack of all trades, which brings more profit to the company. For example, Facebook bought news feeds, and clickbait videos instead of limiting it as a photo-sharing site. Ads are another unwanted thing, but their whole business thrives on it.

> Blockchain doesn't require ads or addictive information to thrive. But do we know how social media should be that values our well-being and social fabric, or do we keep copying and blockchainfying the same successful but flawed and precarious design?
