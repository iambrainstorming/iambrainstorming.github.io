This is what RTI shows:

**[In four years, Modi govt spent over Rs 4,300 crore on publicity.](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-four-years-modi-govt-spent-over-rs-4-300-crore-on-publicity-rti-shows/story-InEz7kP27hlA5ym9BzAxwI.html)**

This is how much other opponents spend on advertisement.

**[Kejriwalâ€™s Delhi govt spent Rs 274 crore on ads since 2015 â€“ four times more than Congress](https://theprint.in/politics/kejriwals-delhi-govt-spent-rs-274-crore-on-ads-since-2015-four-times-more-than-congress/214151/)**

[But if you look at the billionaire entrepreneurs like Ambani, and Mittal, they spend about Rs 50-300 crore per year depending on the market conditions.](https://www.livemint.com/Industry/BNw5kNyk6FE5Ou7Nd8FWRI/Jio-effect-Telecom-firms-ad-spending-rose-50-in-2016-say.html)Â 

## **This is how Advertising works. The Game theory of Advertising.**

> **The payoff is high for both when both the competitor entrepreneurs don't advertise or they do advertise.**

**But entrepreneurs sell products, and money comes from their profit.**

## But what politicians are selling?

> As they are not selling anything, so the payoff will be the same when they all don't advertise or they do advertise. The effect that politicians are seeking through advertising will not change if there is a complete ban on paid advertisements.Â 

## Do you know where does the money on publicity come from?

**Yes, you have correctly guessed, its taxes. But taxes can come from two means:**

1) Through transaction costs, where the govt keeps the cut on the transaction.Â 

2) Printing more money, as govt is a money-printing machine. When govt prints more money, the burden has to beared by common people. A nonobvious way of collecting taxes.Â

Who pays the bad loans (loans given by banks to people who then fail to repay them) or NPA of corporates like Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi? **Do you think the bank?** [ðŸ˜€](https://emojipedia.org/grinning-face/) [ðŸ˜€](https://emojipedia.org/grinning-face/) [ðŸ˜€](https://emojipedia.org/grinning-face/) [ðŸ˜€](https://emojipedia.org/grinning-face/)

As of March 31, 2018,Â [provisional estimates](http://164.100.47.190/loksabhaquestions/annex/15/AU2882.pdf)Â suggest that the total volume of gross NPAs in the economy stands at Rs 10.35 lakh crore.

**So, if you what to know what politicians sell? They sell countries.** 

I already said what is your future with this democracy. The onus lies with the people to bring a good and fair democracy that incentivizes experts with character to join not illiterates, matric pass or hypocrites.Â

> This is how taxpayers' money should be used. To pay for utilitarian services like food, water, electricity, education, transport charges. It will also create a healthy economy because will increase the velocity of money without hoarding and increase entrepreneurship.
