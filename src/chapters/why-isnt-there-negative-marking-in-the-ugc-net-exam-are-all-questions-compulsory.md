I feel that CSIR-NET has better question pattern than UGC NET exam. Making no negative marking will allow a person to attempt all the questions whether he/she knows that answer or not.  
Is it good to attempt the question that a student don't know or no idea on it and still get marks for it?  
It will also increase the probability that mere destiny can help them to qualify the exam, by randomly attempting the questions.
