This will help for both people and govt. to communicate properly with each other. Also help MPs and MLAs to campaign properly, by showing their work.Â 

  

No need of poster or wastage of papers.

  

They can also add the photographs of their work that has been done.

  

It will improve transparency and minimize corruption. I think govt. should initiate this approach, as a result politicians will be encouraged for subscribe To Do list, because people will also want them to subscribe. They may not make it compulsory, but still I think most politician will subscribe it because people and media may ask why they are not subscribing it and not showing their work. Also a good politician will always get a chance to win again.

  

  

People may also provide feedback and opinions of their work in the website.
