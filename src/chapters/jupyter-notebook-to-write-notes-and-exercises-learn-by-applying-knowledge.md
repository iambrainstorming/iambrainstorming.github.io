### Jupyter notebook can be used to make your notes and solve exercises with programming without using pen and paper.

In order to write notes, you can use markdown which is a very simple markup language and can be learned within 15mins to get started. You can use latex and Unicode characters to write equations and symbols.

To learn latex you can use google, e.g. website

**Jupyter notebook can be used in any subjects where the calculation is required, such as physics, mathematics, economics, even biology etc.**

No need to scratch your head, if you forgot the formula, or made mistakes in calculation when done with pen and paper.

**Learn by applying things that will be useful in real life situations**  
**Everyone should learn code, in early age just like other subjects. One computer to each child is required.**
