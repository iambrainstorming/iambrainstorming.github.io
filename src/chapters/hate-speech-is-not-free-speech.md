Social media is filled with information pollution, hate speech, propaganda, and echo chambers and alternative facts. Not all voices are equal in our current social media. Influencers and marketers amplify their tweets by the redundant fake account. It's not surprising that trashy tweets of politicians get lakhs of retweets, where more than 90% of retweets are from the same company or IT cell.  
Social media has become a key part of our communication. Low-value information can cause anxiety, decision paralysis, and loss of perspective and moral values.  
The unique point of social media like twitter are ideas, humor, blog links, and positive activism for social change. Most active social media are in control of centralized moderations, and their profit-seeking model doesn't allow to curb the junk, as their funding comes from more engagement rather than maintaining the quality. These social media can be purchased and controlled by billionaires like Elon Mosk and their functionality can be changed by the whims of these billionaires.

There are many open-source social media, but they still fail at decentralized moderation and can be easily hacked by marketers.  
What we need is moderation through community governance with an incentive system to behave decently on the platform, so that social media are emotionally safe and takes care of our well-being rather than an additive model.  
Blockchain KYC technology like proof of humanity can eliminate Sybil attacks on social media, algorithms like schelling game (Kleros) can incentivize to derive the truth, follow the hate speech or information pollution guidelines. ZKsnarks can take care of privacy for sharing sensitive information by protecting through anonymity.

> Social media belongs to common people, for their issues, concerns, and well-being, not billionaires, politicians, marketers, or influencers.
