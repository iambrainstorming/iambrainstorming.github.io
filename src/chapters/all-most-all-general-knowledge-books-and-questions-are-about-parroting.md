> Books lack the depth, inquiry, reasoning and critical thinking, it is just about memorising names of persons and places, and dates through parroting the quizzes and questions.

Students given to memorise names of famous artists

Take for example:  
Book asks to name the national parks of India.  
What's the point in memorizing names of different national parks, if you don't know anything about ecology; if you can't see and feel the environment and lifestyle of exotic and endangered wildlife in that national park?

In many entrances including B.Ed, GK in one of the subjects, and students end up parroting the names. It also takes a huge chunk of time in schools, what if it were used for more meaningful learning.
