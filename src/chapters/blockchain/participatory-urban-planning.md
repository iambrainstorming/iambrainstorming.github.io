# 🏙️ Participatory Urban Planning (Blockchain + GIS + Conviction Voting Reputation)

Date: 29-01-2026

## 1. What “Participatory Urban Planning” Means Here

Traditional participatory planning has two problems:

1. **Low-quality participation** (uninformed opinions, populism)
2. **No accountability** (opinions cost nothing)

Your model fixes this by:

* Grounding decisions in **verifiable GIS data**
* Separating **citizen voice** from **expert decision-making**
* Using **reputation and conviction**, not just money

So participation becomes **structured, weighted, and accountable**.

## 2. System Architecture (High-Level)

### Layer 1: **Objective Reality (GIS Layer)**

The town/city is fully mapped:

* 🌳 Green cover (tree density, heat islands)
* 🚰 Drainage systems (blockages, pollution levels)
* 🗑️ Garbage hotspots
* 🚲 Bike lanes & walkability
* 🚦 Traffic density & accident zones
* 🏭 Pollution sources (air, water, noise)

This layer is **non-negotiable**—opinions cannot override data.

---

### Layer 2: **Citizens (Voters)**

Citizens:

* Observe lived reality
* Validate problems
* Express priorities (what hurts most)

They **do not design solutions**—they guide *what matters*.

---

### Layer 3: **Experts (Approved via Conviction Voting)**

Experts include:

* Urban planners
* Traffic engineers
* Environmental scientists
* Waste-management professionals
* GIS analysts

**Selection method**:

* Citizens approve experts using **conviction voting**
* Long-term trust > one-time popularity
* Experts can lose standing if consistently misaligned

This avoids:

* One-off popularity contests
* Political capture

---

### Layer 4: **Proposal Evaluation (Score Voting by Experts)**

Experts submit or evaluate proposals:

* Drainage redesign
* New bike lanes
* Garbage processing units
* Tree plantation zones
* Traffic re-routing

Experts score proposals **1–10**.

## 3. ⚙️ The Reputation-Based Model (Much Better)

Here’s where your idea really shines.

### Reputation Tokens (Non-Tradable)

* Earned through voting alignment
* Cannot be sold
* Only usable for governance power

If mean score = 6:
→ Expert/handle earns **600 reputation tokens**

These tokens:

* Increase conviction voting weight
* Increase proposal influence
* Decay if inactive or misaligned

## Example Use Cases
### Case Study 1: Drainage System Overhaul

Problem Mapped in GIS:
- Three neighborhoods experience flooding during heavy rain
- Water quality sensors show contamination in drainage outlets
- Historical data shows increasing severity over 5 years

Expert Action:

- Drainage engineer and environmental specialist collaborate
- Proposal: Install bio-retention systems, upgrade pipe capacity, add permeable pavement
- GIS visualization shows drainage catchment areas and proposed interventions
- Score voting prioritizes this as high urgency, high impact

Implementation:

- Phased construction over 18 months
- Real-time monitoring shows reduced flooding and improved water quality
- Success documented in GIS, boosting credibility of proposing experts


### Case Study 2: Bike Lane Network Expansion

Problem Mapped in GIS:

- Traffic data shows congestion on major corridors
- Air quality poor in city center
- Survey data shows demand for cycling infrastructure
- Accident data shows dangerous intersections for cyclists

Expert Action:

- Transportation specialist and urban planner create comprehensive bike network plan
- Protected lanes on main streets, traffic calming measures, bike-share stations
- GIS data shows proposed routes optimized for connectivity and safety

Score Voting:

- High marks for environmental impact and social equity
- Implementation phased over 3 years by priority corridors

Monitoring:

- Traffic counters track bicycle usage growth
- Air quality improvements measured
- Accident rates decrease in protected segments

### Case Study 3: Urban Greening Initiative

Problem Mapped in GIS:

- Heat island effect severe in low-income neighborhoods
- Limited tree canopy coverage
- Few accessible parks in high-density areas

Expert Action:

- Landscape architect and public health expert propose multi-faceted greening
- Street tree planting, pocket parks, green roofs, community gardens
- GIS analysis shows optimal locations based on heat, demographics, available land

Implementation:

- Community engagement in tree species selection
- Training programs for garden maintenance
- Temperature sensors track cooling effects
- Health surveys measure recreational use and well-being impacts
