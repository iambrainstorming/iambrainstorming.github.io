> Coronavirus and social distancing can prepare us for a healthy economic model that can work for any period of time. 

Pollution rates are going down, lakes are becoming clean, deers are coming to the roads. In other words, nature is taking over the world. 

People are working from home and are getting more family time.

All these are transcendent for human beings, which needs to be celebrated.  

But many politicians are concerned that it will have a serious negative impact on the economy? But is it so? Or it's because of the present economy itself is in bad design.

Social distancing promotes remote working:

Here is why remote working is the best way of working.

[https://iambrainstorming.wordpress.com/2020/02/16/how-to-beat-the-worst-job-culture-of-india/](https://iambrainstorming.wordpress.com/2020/02/16/how-to-beat-the-worst-job-culture-of-india/)

More autonomy, more productivity, more happiness as you are no more under the robotic control and surveillance of a boss to micromanage all your tasks.

Take for example [https://gitcoin.co/](https://gitcoin.co/) for remote working. 

Take another example of overcrowded schools. Do you require such schools? Or you can learn from home. Local teachers can come to your location. Teachers can also teach remotely. Like in case of higher education, students are first taught locally about [learning strategies](https://iambrainstorming.wordpress.com/2017/01/14/all-books-that-dont-meet-the-learning-criteria-must-be-taken-off/) with [close observation](https://iambrainstorming.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/importance-of-educational-videos-and-solving-its-limitation-by-teachers-assistance/) and then after making students autonomous, they can be taught remotely with best content. Less teacher and student ratio and students can maintain an appropriate distance. 

Here are an example and incentive model of how local decentralized schooling can work.

Even democracy and policymaking can be handled remotely or locally without needing transportation or crowding.

Regarding handling the supply chain, do we require so many people to handle it? 

Learn from Amazon, how it handles supply chain with automation.

But the problem with Amazon is it's not decentralized and it's not healthy for our economy. All profits are kept by Amazon, and it kills the income of local sellers. But the decentralized organization can be designed with blockchain using cryptocurrency, which has the same supply chain model of amazon but instead, profits are shared with the customers and incentive models designed is pro-economy. 

All most about 80% of jobs are bullshit, either unnecessary because it can be taken by robots or don't provide any utility which creates negative externalities. The problem is just we don't have a mechanism to distribute the profits with people for the work done by robots. 

**What Is a Bullshit Job?**

Here’s Graeber’s definition, which he constructs carefully over many pages: “**a bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.**”

Another good situation coronavirus is creating, is people are leaving the abusive low paying jobs and coming to their homes. 

And regarding currency, many countries are seeking debt or providing heavy currency packages. Remember, the currency is not money. Real money is precious metals like gold and silver that always maintains its value. Such heavy packages can devalue the currency and bring us to the recession.

Cryptocurrency has properties similar to gold and silver. Take for example DAI cryptocurrency coin. 1 DAI pegged to 1 dollar. The dollar can be devalued by bad policies of politicians. But, we can create cryptocurrency using the same mechanism of DAI that is pegged to Gold. Take for example 0.001oz of gold = 1 DAI, so that it never gets devalued. 

> Blockchain is for decentralization and remote working as incentives are not decided by your boss but by the community and game-theoretic algorithms.

Reinventing Organisations

5G connections and [LPWAN](https://radiobridge.com/blog/lpwan-for-iot-sensors) networks using blockchain can further scaffold the process of remote working and global collaboration.

> We just can't go the previous situation of chaos after coronavirus is controlled. We just need more designers who can bring good incentive models to the blockchain. 

Its time to think right. Money is a fiction and should be treated as such.  
We don't need money to serve the rich and powerful, but to generate good behavior and best services for each and every one. Money was created for the community not just for individual needs.
