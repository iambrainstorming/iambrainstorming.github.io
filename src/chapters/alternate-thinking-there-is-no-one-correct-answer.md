How education hinders alternate way of thinking?

A teacher gave the following question in MCQs:  
If you add some dissolving solute to water, does there is a change in total mass i.e. (\[mass of water + mass of sugar\]) changes?  
a) There is no change in total mass  
b) There is change in total mass  
Student wrote:  
b)  
Teacher gave the mark: zero  
  
What if the student thought the following deeper idea to answer the question. When we add a solute to water, the reaction can be endothermic or exothermic, Â so if heat is released in case of exothermic, an amount of mass is converted to heat, so there is little decrease in mass that is difficult to measure. For an endothermic reaction, some amount of heat is absorbed, so there is little increase in mass.  
  
So the answer can depend on scientific theory, concepts, inductive or deductive reasoning, premise, and method or procedure used.  
  
  

> There are no one 'correct' answer, the answer can depend on the process of thinking and context.
