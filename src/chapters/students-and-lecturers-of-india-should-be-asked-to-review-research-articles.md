Peer-review increases critical thinking, questioning, and reasoning skills among research faculties should be given in projects to earn credits, not just for publishing paper, in universities  
  
A peer-reviewer decides and introspects the authenticity of the article. Finding the error in a technical article requires rigorous effort and knowledge about the subject. Also, a peer-reviewer contribution is outstandingly important and shouldn't be ignored when compared with the author.  
  
Post-publication peer-review and pre-publication peer-review, both can be given to research faculties, so that they can earn credit for it.  
  
**What projects can be given to students at elementary schools and undergraduate or higher Â level?**  
  
**Let's talk about a project at undergraduate level:**  
After a particular concept of a subject is taught, e.g genetics, students can be asked to review an article searching the database such as PubMed using the keyword.  
  
Let them describe a particular article in the class.  
  
But to describe a particular article, guidelines should be made.  
  
**How does a debate happen in schools in India?**  
Most of the debate that happens in schools are not debate. Only you will find the nervous speaker (student) giving the speech and other students become almost passive, no participation at all. Teachers judge students based upon how efficiently he/she has spoken in confidence, how was his/her accent, almost no credits for what he/she spoke on the topic or how much knowledge he/she has or gained about the topic. Also, when in the stage, children forget about what to speak in nervousness and are disqualified.  
  
**Here are the changes we should make:**  
1) The discussion should be inquiry based in a trivial manner, the way students communicate with each other when not in class.  
2) No judgment for asking stupid questions, as long as it is in the context of the subject.  
3) Students should be taught what probing questions are, and should be encouraged to ask such type of questions.

4) The student can use the written article paper to describe it.  
5) The teacher should make sure that all participate in the discussion, and share question and answers with each other.  
6) There will be many many questions which students wouldn't know, sometimes nor the teacher. These questions should be noted down on paper by a student.  
It's a general tendency of our students to expect our teacher to know everything, and teacher also pretends to know everything by ignoring the questions asked or sometimes they again counter question the students to harass them so that they stop asking. **Such a perception is too harmful hinders the growth of both teacher and student.**  
7) Next, homework should be to find those answers by both student and teacher, and discuss it in next class.
