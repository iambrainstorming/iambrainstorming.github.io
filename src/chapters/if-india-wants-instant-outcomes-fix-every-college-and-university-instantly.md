Children will take another 20 years to add value to the economy.  
  
How to?  
  
1) Terminate all rote learning [content](http://technoperiod.blogspot.com/2017/01/all-books-that-dont-meet-learning.html), and provide them with pedagogically sound recent content. Let content be the syllabus.  
2) Provide [personalized](http://technoperiod.blogspot.com/2017/02/personalized-learning-goals-new.html) education, and address learning deficit of students.  
3) Bring projects under peer review, and make the project open access if it's not patentable.  
4) Ask the [teacher](http://technoperiod.blogspot.com/2017/12/higher-education-must-immediately-stop.html) to [unlearn](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d) almost everything they learned during schools and colleges. Use [evidence, evidence, and evidence](https://github.com/amiyatulu/teacher_resources).  
5) Make [exams](https://iambrainstorming.ml/index.php/2018/06/26/how-to-guide-for-preparing-hots-question/) analytical and [cue-based](https://iambrainstorming.ml/index.php/2018/02/17/question-designing-should-be-brain-friendly-cue-based/), not the reproduction of the text of books.  
6) Pay the teacher well, so that teachership will be treated as a respectable job.
